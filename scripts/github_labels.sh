# Sprint 11 Goal 7, the bug pipeline's GitHub half: the repository's label set, as code -- plus, since 2026-09-23,
# the known-issue stack's four extra areas and its two markers (docs/GIT_STRATEGY.md section 7).
#
# Run once per repository (and again whenever a label is added or its wording changes):
#
#     bash scripts/github_labels.sh              # the real repository, github.com/Scotho/socom-unzipped
#     bash scripts/github_labels.sh --dry-run    # print the gh commands and touch nothing
#     GITHUB_LABELS_REPO=me/fork bash scripts/github_labels.sh
#
# Every label is created with `gh label create --force`, so the script is IDEMPOTENT: a second run updates the
# colour and the description of a label that already exists instead of failing, and nothing is ever deleted --
# a label this file does not name is left alone, because issues may already carry it.
#
# Labels are repository metadata, not permissions: this touches no ruleset, no branch protection and no
# collaborator (docs/HANDOFF.md rule 13 -- those stay the owner's). It needs `gh auth login` with write access
# to issues; tools_py/tests/test_github_labels.py only parses the list below and never runs gh.

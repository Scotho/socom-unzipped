#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Launch a long job (a game run, a build, a gate) detached from the agent's tool call, holding the loop
# lock for exactly as long as the job's PID lives.
#
# Usage: scripts/run_detached.sh [--owner <o>] [--purpose <p>] [--log <path>] [--quiet]
#                                [--wait <minutes> | --wait-seconds <s>] <script> <marker> [args...]
#
#   - refuses to start (exit 3, before touching the lock) when C: has less than RUN_MIN_FREE_GB
#     (default 4) GB free -- Sprint 5 R46/A5, the host was at ~9 GB. RUN_FREE_GB_CMD overrides the
#     free-space query (a shell command whose last stdout line is the free GB figure) for tests;
#   - takes the loop lock as <owner> (default "detached"); if it is BUSY, writes "exit=75 BUSY ..." to
#     <marker> and exits 75 without launching. With --wait (Sprint 13 H2) it QUEUES instead
#     (`loop_lock.sh wait`: a ticket, served in arrival order) for up to that long, in the foreground --
#     run it in the background of a tool call if the wait may be long -- and only a TIMEOUT writes
#     "exit=75 TIMEOUT ..." to <marker>. Until the lock is had, <marker> does not exist;
#   - a CHAIN is one run_detached of the chain script: its steps run under that one holding (their own
#     loop_lock.sh take/run are NESTED); a run_detached INSIDE a held lock is refused (exit 2);
#   - launches `bash <script> [args...]` under nohup, stdout+stderr to <log> (default <marker>.log), and
#     returns at once, printing "DETACHED pid=... marker=... log=...";
#   - renews the heartbeat every LOOP_LOCK_DETACHED_RENEW_SEC (300) while the JOB's PID lives -- the
#     renew loop watches the job, never the caller, whose shell dies when its tool call returns;
#   - QUIET MARKER (R46/A8: "no build.sh test, sims, unittest suites... while it exists"): while the
#     job runs, if --purpose (or the lock's default purpose) starts with "launch", or --quiet is given,
#     writes RUN_QUIET_MARKER (default: logs/.quiet of the MAIN tree, beside git's common dir, as the lock
#     itself -- audit H13, Sprint 13: a per-checkout marker let a worktree's launch run beside a main-tree
#     `build.sh test` and vice versa) as one line "<owner> <winpid> <start
#     epoch> <msys pid>" -- the pid field is the WINDOWS pid (via /proc/<msys pid>/winpid), because
#     check_quiet_gate.sh and any other host-side liveness probe (tasklist, Get-Process) work in
#     that domain, not MSYS's; removed on every exit path (normal, failure, or signalled) EXCEPT a
#     SIGKILL of this wrapper itself, which no trap can catch -- see "Known limitations" below;
#   - HOST CPU SAMPLER: while the job runs (unless RUN_CPU_SAMPLER=0), a background PowerShell loop
#     appends one row per second to "<marker>.cpu.csv": timestamp, total % Processor Time, and a
#     "name=pct" list for every running socom2* process (Get-Counter's per-instance suffixing). Killed
#     on exit alongside the job;
#   - when the job exits: releases the lock, stops the CPU sampler, removes the quiet marker, then
#     writes "exit=<code>" to <marker> (release first, so a poller that sees the marker finds the lock
#     free);
#   - on TERM/HUP/INT it kills the job's whole Windows process tree (`taskkill /T /F`), releases, and
#     writes "exit=143";
#   - if a renew finds the lock no longer ours, it writes a "LOCK LOST" line to <log> and to
#     <marker>.LOCK_LOST, stops renewing, and lets the job finish (the final marker line then reads
#     "exit=<code> LOCK_LOST"). The job is not killed.
#
# THE JOB SCRIPT MUST KEEP ITS WORK IN THE FOREGROUND. The lock lives exactly as long as the script's
# own PID: anything it backgrounds (`cmd &`, `nohup`, `Start-Process`) and does not wait for keeps
# running after the lock is released, unrenewed and unguarded (only the busy list stands between it and
# the next build).
#
# Poll the marker (`test -f <marker>`), never the caller. Inside the script, `loop_lock.sh take/release`
# (gate.py's own included) are NESTED no-ops: LOOP_LOCK_HELD is exported to the job.
# A pre-existing <marker> is deleted before launch. Environment: as loop_lock.sh (LOOP_LOCK_PATH, ...),
# plus RUN_MIN_FREE_GB, RUN_FREE_GB_CMD, RUN_QUIET_MARKER, RUN_CPU_SAMPLER above.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATIONS
#   - A SIGKILL of the --_child wrapper itself (as opposed to TERM/HUP/INT, which the trap handles)
#     cannot be caught: the quiet marker and the CPU sampler process are both leaked -- the marker
#     goes stale (check_quiet_gate.sh's age check is what recovers a build from it after
#     QUIET_GATE_MAX_AGE_S) and the orphaned sampler keeps a powershell.exe running and appending to
#     "<marker>.cpu.csv" until killed by hand or the machine reboots. Not otherwise guarded against.

# Sprint 8 Goal 1: sync the tree (and, on request, the generated code and the ISO) into the socom-linux VM over SSH.
# The host has no rsync, so the tree travels as a tar stream; the generated code likewise; the ISO by scp once.

#                                  # (tools_py/vm_prune.py), or a moved file keeps shadowing its new home.

# The merged chain -- the gate unit (Sprint 14 Task W2; spec Milestone W, W2). An agent's task is DONE (code) at a
# clean review of its branch; the proof is this chain, run ONCE per batch of merged branches on the sprint branch:
#
#   recomp -> runtime -> suites -> gate (on the exe it just built) -> the fourth leg (E2, scored on the gate's run) -> release build ->
#   the release archive and PLAYTEST's build block (D5: playtest_block.sh --release)
#
# RUN A COPY, NEVER THIS FILE: bash reads a script by offset, and a merge that rewrites the tracked template under a
# running chain breaks it at the edit point. The controller copies it into the tree's (git-ignored) logs/ and
# launches the copy once, under ONE holding of the loop lock:
#
#   cp scripts/parity/merged_chain.sh logs/s14_merged_chain.sh
#   bash scripts/run_detached.sh --owner <o> --purpose "merged chain" --wait <minutes> \
#       logs/s14_merged_chain.sh logs/s14_merged_chain.detached [<gate stamp>]
#
# (or `bash scripts/loop_lock.sh run <o> --wait <minutes> -- bash logs/s14_merged_chain.sh [<stamp>]`). Every step's
# own lock use -- build.sh's check, gate.py's take -- is NESTED under that holding (LOOP_LOCK_HELD; the header of
# scripts/loop_lock.sh). The chain itself takes, waits for and releases nothing: one take per step would leave a gap
# between steps, and the queue grants that gap to its head. Outside a live holding (LOOP_LOCK_HELD unset, or not
# the live record's id) it refuses, exit 2, before anything runs.
#
# THE TREE: the chain refuses (exit 2) a tree with ANY modified tracked file -- it proves a commit, not a working
# copy, and the controller stashes nothing on another session's behalf. After every step it looks again: a step that
# changed a tracked file is red (the PLAYTEST step may change docs/PLAYTEST.md, which it exists to rewrite; the close
# commits that block -- nothing is committed mid-chain). HEAD is checked after every step too: a commit or checkout
# mid-chain is red ("HEAD moved from <h0> to <h1> during <step>") and records nothing.
#
# RED: the first failing step ends the chain with its exit code and prints the merges since the last green chain
# (`git log --merges --first-parent <last green>..HEAD`; the last green is the commit hash in
# logs/merged_chain.last_green, written only at a green end; with no record, the merges since MERGED_CHAIN_BASE,
# default main) and the eviction procedure, docs/GIT_STRATEGY.md "Slices": bisect by branch, evict the culprit with
# `git revert -m 1 <merge>` on the sprint branch, record it in the plan's Log with the reason, re-queue the branch for
# its author.
#
# Records: logs/<this script's name>.done -- "done 0 all-green", "done <rc> <step>" or "done 2 refused-<why>";
# logs/merged_chain.last_green -- the commit a green chain proved; logs/.merged_chain.running -- present exactly while
# the steps run (written after the tree and HEAD0 are fixed, removed by an EXIT trap; never on a refusal or a dry
# run): the hooks refuse a commit, and an Edit/Write of a tracked file, in this tree while it names a live pid
# (Sprint 17 G1; tools_py/hooks/chainmark.py).
#
# Environment: MERGED_CHAIN_DRY_RUN=1 prints the steps and runs none, checks no lock, writes nothing, and exits 3 --
# never 0, so a leaked switch can never make a chain green. For tools_py/tests/test_merged_chain.py:
# MERGED_CHAIN_LOCK_SH (the lock script asked for the live id), MERGED_CHAIN_LEG_REFS (the E2 references' directory,
# default scripts/parity/refs/heldout/), MERGED_CHAIN_BASE (main), BUILD_LAUNCHER_CHECK_CMD (the running-launcher
# query, build.sh's: a running launcher is refused before step 1, exit 2, "done 2 refused-launcher-running"). PYTHON
# as scripts/python_env.sh.

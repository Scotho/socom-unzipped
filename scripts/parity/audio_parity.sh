# The audio parity check (Sprint 9 Q0, owner 2026-09-20: "an audio parity test with PCSX2 like our visual parity
# test"). One target, one capture, one score file; then `compare` against the pinned console reference.
#
#   scripts/parity/audio_parity.sh capture <pcsx2|ours> <stamp> [script.txt] [drive_s] [record_s]   # under the lock
#   scripts/parity/audio_parity.sh compare <stamp> [ref.json]                  # lock-free: PASS/FAIL per step window
#
# The capture records what Windows sends to the DEFAULT output endpoint (WASAPI loopback) while drive.py plays the
# step script on the target -- so it measures the whole path to the speaker, which is what the owner hears and what
# the visual gate's audio dump never could. Reference: scripts/parity/refs/audio_<script>.pcsx2.json, pinned from a
# PCSX2 capture of the same script. Windows routes PCSX2 per app (docs/HAZARDS.md audio): instance A's override silences
# it at every endpoint, so for a pcsx2 capture this script removes that override for the run and restores it after.
#
# W7 (fix wave A, 2026-09-22): `drive_s` (the game's own run length, drive.py --seconds) and `record_s` (the
# loopback recording) are arguments, defaulting to the 600 / 620 the launch_to_mission_xl reference was pinned
# with -- a script that holds in the mission for ten minutes needs both longer, and every earlier invocation
# (three arguments or fewer) behaves exactly as before. AUDIO_DUMP=<path> in the environment is exported to the
# launched game as PS2X_AUDIO_DUMP, so a capture can have the mixer's own pre-device WAV beside the endpoint
# recording (scripts/parity/mission_music_long.sh is the caller that sets it; unset, nothing is written).

# audio tools come from beside this script (TOOLS_ROOT), so a capture run from a worktree exercises the worktree's
# recorder, monitor and scorers: `python -P` keeps the cwd off sys.path and PYTHONPATH names the tools' tree. The

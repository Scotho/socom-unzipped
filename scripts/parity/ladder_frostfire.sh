# Pinning (scripts/pin_harness.sh: `git archive HEAD tools_py scripts` into <out_dir>/harness with HARNESS_COMMIT /
# EXE_BUILD) is CHECKED: a non-zero exit, an incomplete snapshot or a pinned import that does not resolve under the
# snapshot (python compares real paths) fails the launch loudly (exit 7, PIN-FAIL) -- never a silent fall back to the
# live tree. The child runs PYTHONPATH=<snapshot> PYTHONSAFEPATH=1 from the repo root, so a 30 min launch is scored by the
# reviewed code and its RESULT lines print harness=<commit> exe=<sha>.
#
# Markers: run_detached.sh writes `exit=<code>` to logs/<name>.detached when the lock is released; the child writes
# logs/<name>.done as its last act: `done <rc> mpexit=<rc> <outcome> harness=<commit> <EXE_BUILD>`, <outcome> one of
# LOBBY-FAIL <class> (exit 4, R47: no round was played -- never a usable round, nothing toward the A1 stop rules),
# KILL (0), NO-KILL (1), NO-DATA (2), NO-CONTROL (3), CRASH (5: an uncaught harness exception -- never NO-KILL),
# PIN-FAIL (7), EXIT-<rc>.
#
# Before a launch (plan Task 5 Step 3): the local Horizon stack running (server/), persona B on game/disc/mc0_b
# (--existing-b), no socom2.exe running, `powershell -File scripts/kill_stale_drivers.ps1`, no other heavy host work.
# SOCOM_SERVER_IP (scripts/parity/env.sh) is the server: the hosted box by name unless set; for a Horizon
# stack on this machine, set it to this machine's LAN address.
#
# Instruments: scripts/parity/online_match_frostfire.sh's (MoveScale + NetIdle at EVERY=10; the actor block, +0x420,
# +0x174, the +0xF7A alive byte (inside the +0xF78 peek), +0x1044 health; CZNetGame + valves with name bytes; mission abort; the round clocks
# 0x4365c0 and 0x408f10) plus PS2X_GS_STATS=1 for rung 0's back-pressure waits (A4).
#
# Knobs (environment): ROUTE (default: the SNAPSHOT's tools_py/parity/routes/frostfire_v2.json; the live tree's for an
# unpinned --dry-run), ROUNDS (4), MOVER (A), --auto-swap always (R66: a SWAP-MOVER continues with the other mover),
# SECONDS_RUN (2400: ~4 rounds of ~6.5 min + the lobby), PS2X_GS_MAX_PENDING_FRAMES (unset; 0 is the rung-0 A/B knob),
# PIN_HARNESS_SH (scripts/pin_harness.sh; tests substitute a failing one), RUN_DETACHED_SH (scripts/run_detached.sh;
# tests substitute one that records its arguments).

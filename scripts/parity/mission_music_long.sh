# W7 (fix wave A, 2026-09-22): the mission-music instrument. The owner, on tonight's playthrough: "one song
# playing with stutters or skips ... it is not playing linearly ... fine the first while, gets much worse as I
# proceed", and: "You may have to write tests that skip the cutscenes and move faster to catch these issues."
#
# So: reach gameplay by the fast path (scripts/parity/mission_music_fast.txt -- the cinematics skipped, the
# flyover pressed through until the HUD band matches), then HOLD IN THE MISSION for as long as the run asks,
# with the audio captured twice over -- the mixer's own pre-device WAV (PS2X_AUDIO_DUMP) and the WASAPI
# loopback of what Windows actually sends the speaker -- and score the capture minute by minute so the
# degradation the owner describes is a column of numbers rather than an impression.
#
#   scripts/parity/mission_music_long.sh [--minutes N] [--stage mission|briefing] [--walk] [--target ours|pcsx2]
#                                        [--stamp S] [--max-device-per-minute N] [--no-score] [--dry-run]
#
# --dry-run generates the drive script and prints the lengths, launching nothing: it is how the script itself is
# checked without the loop lock (and how tools_py/tests/test_mission_music_fast.py checks the generated hold).
#
# --walk (fix wave A follow-up, 2026-09-22): the mission hold MOVES. The two-minute proof run showed that a driven
# hold at the insertion point captures almost no music (2-4 s voice cues, the mix at -51 dBFS), while the owner's
# report is the music degrading "as I proceed". So instead of `wait+8.0:NONE` the hold is a repeated short leg --
# `hold+8.0:W` (walk forward 8 s), `wait+2.0:NONE`, `hold+8.0:S` (walk back 8 s), `wait+2.0:NONE` -- the pattern
# gameplay_damage.txt already uses, which returns to the insertion point every 20 s. Walking blind into the level
# meets hostiles, and a death ends the capture and the music with it, so the leg is deliberately SHORT and safe
# rather than the owner's route (which nobody has recorded); the same run serves W6 (the garbled HELP popup) if a
# popup arrives, since every `ifpopup` guard saves the frame it looks at before pressing. Mission stage only.
#
# --max-device-per-minute N: the pin. After the dips scorer runs, its "DEVICE total .. max K in a minute" line is
# read and the run exits 4 when K > N. Unset = report only; the ceiling is pinned once the endpoint A/B has said
# what a clean device looks like (docs/archive/sprints-7-12/2026-09-22-fix-wave-handoff.md).
#
# Run it under the loop lock (it launches a game):
#   scripts/loop_lock.sh run <owner> --purpose "W7 mission music" -- scripts/parity/mission_music_long.sh --minutes 12
#
# --minutes is the IN-MISSION hold (default 12: the owner's "fine the first while, gets much worse as I
# proceed" needs the capture to contain both halves, and W7's bar is at least ten minutes of mission). The hold
# is built by copying mission_music_fast.txt and appending `wait+8.0:NONE` lines to it, so the generated script
# is committed nowhere and is written beside the capture it produced (logs/parity/<stamp>/drive_script.txt) --
# the schedule is an argument, the path is the file.
#
# The capture itself is scripts/parity/audio_parity.sh's, unchanged apart from its new length arguments: the
# loopback recorder, the per-app volume hold (Windows remembers a per-exe session volume that sits BEFORE the
# loopback tap) and drive.py, sequenced as the audio parity runs already sequence them. AUDIO_DUMP is passed
# through to the launched game as PS2X_AUDIO_DUMP, with PS2X_DEV=1 beside it: that knob is Dev-class (R238
# weighed reclassing it Shipping and did not), and a Dev knob needs developer mode to be honoured at all.
#
# Scoring (W7 reuses, it does not invent):
#   * tools_py/parity/audio_envelope.py --segment 60 is the primary read. It is REFERENCE-FREE and its four
#     measurements are the owner's four words: envelope (the loudness curve), oscillation_score ("louder and
#     quieter"), splices ("jumping between tracks" / "not playing linearly") and silences (a stream underrun
#     heard as a skip). One line per minute plus a totals line means "fine at first, much worse later" is read
#     straight off the per-segment column -- which is the thing W7 has to show and which no ours-vs-console
#     score can show, because both machines are scored within one capture over time here.
#   * tools_py/parity/audio_dips.py is the follow-up when the envelope finds dips: it aligns the endpoint
#     recording to the mixer's dump and classifies each dip DEVICE / STARVATION / COMMAND / UNEXPLAINED
#     against the game log, which is what says whether a skip was lost after render() or starved before it.
#   * tools_py/parity/audio_parity.py is deliberately NOT the scorer here: it scores step-aligned windows
#     against a PCSX2 reference pinned per script (scripts/parity/refs/audio_<script>.pcsx2.json), and no such
#     reference exists for this script -- pinning one costs a console run of the same length, and it would
#     still compare ours to the console rather than the capture's start to its end. `audio_parity.sh capture`
#     writes its audio_scores.json anyway as a by-product; it is evidence, not the verdict.

# two-minute proof run showed why it is needed: standing still in the mission, the only streams that play are
# two-to-four-second voice cues and the mix sits at -51 dBFS, so a twelve-minute in-mission hold captures
# almost no music at all. The briefing's score plays continuously at about -32 dBFS, and it is where the owner
# reported the FIRST half of the fault ("menu music seemed good up until the point i was in the mission
# briefing, i noticed the first few small stutters"). The mission half of their report -- the music degrading
# the longer they played -- needs the drive to MOVE through the mission, which is a route, not a hold; see the
# plan's W7 follow-up.

  # 6: and what the two paths actually draw, pixel for pixel, into a 640x448 framebuffer. The host
  #    path keeps the sub-1/16-pixel fraction the GIF path truncates, so edge and gouraud-rounding
  #    pixels differ by design; anything past the tolerance means a wrong lane or a wrong context.
  #    The score is hard / drawn, NOT differing / whole frame: these dumps paint 26..3291 pixels of
  #    a 286720-pixel frame, so a frame-relative score tops out at 0.32% here and could not fail at
  #    1% however wrong the drawing was (measured: forcing the host path +8 px in x leaves 9 of the
  #    10 dumps that existed then at 0.0000-0.2570% of frame).
  #    "hard" excludes the two differences the two paths produce by design, both measured on this
  #    fixture set rather than assumed. Each has an opaque form and a form that only appears once
  #    the draw is blended or the seam is interior (Sprint 4 task 3 widened both; before that,
  #    vu1dump4_prog_182 scored 1.488% and was held out of this set):
  #      - rounding: max channel delta <= 1 -- one step of gouraud interpolation -- which is
  #        174/179, 897/922, 67/69 and 63/66 of those dumps' differing pixels. Plus, on a dump
  #        whose kicked packets set PRIM.ABE and only where BOTH passes drew the pixel, max channel
  #        delta <= 2: the blend turns that one source step into two destination steps (the
  #        measured cases are alpha 127 against 128). Gated on ABE because on an opaque draw a
  #        delta of 2 is a real difference -- though note that every dump in this corpus kicks
  #        PRIM 0x7b (prog_31: 0x4b), i.e. ABE = 1, so the gate does not discriminate here yet.
  #      - edge: a differing pixel whose 3x3 neighbourhood is not uniformly drawn in one of the two
  #        renderings, i.e. sub-pixel coverage at a triangle edge (delta 127/128 = drawn vs blank).
  #        Plus the interior form of the same thing: a colour seam between two adjacent triangles
  #        that sits one pixel over with both sides drawn, so the 3x3 is uniformly drawn and no
  #        coverage boundary fires. It is recognised as each rendering's colour at the pixel
  #        appearing within 2 on a DRAWN pixel of the other rendering's eight neighbours, in both
  #        directions (a seam that moved swaps the two sides' colours) and never the centre pixel
  #        (matching the centre would silently mean "delta <= 2 is always fine"). That clause is
  #        BUDGETED at 1% of drawn and reported as seam=N on the VRAMDIFF line: a real seam is a
  #        few pixels along one edge, but a UNIFORM one-pixel offset of the whole drawing
  #        satisfies it EVERYWHERE, so past the budget every pixel it accepted goes back to hard
  #        and the line says OVER-BUDGET. On a clean build the clause is used on three dumps only
  #        -- 4 px on prog_11 (0.12%), 3 on prog_177 (0.24%), 3 on prog_182 (0.50%) -- so the
  #        thinnest margin to the budget is 2x. Thin, and deliberately visible.
  #    What is left on a clean build is 0 on all fifteen dumps. Sensitivity, measured by shifting
  #    the host path inside the hook (dumps over the 1% tolerance, of fifteen, and their range):
  #        +1 px x   8 fail, 1.64-11.65%        +1 px y   6 fail, 1.42-16.74%
  #        +2 px x   7 fail, 1.64-19.01%        +8 px x   9 fail, 7.07-55.48%
  #    The six that never fail are the six whose host path the hook never takes -- their two
  #    renderings are already bit-identical -- so no offset can move them. The +8 px column is
  #    within 0.7 points of what the pre-widening buckets score on the same renders (7.07-56.19%).
  #    Read the +-1 px column as the reason the budget exists: WITHOUT it, the seam clause scores
  #    those same +-1 px renders at 0.00-0.08% and fails NOTHING, and the +8 px experiment alone
  #    would never have shown that -- a systematic one-pixel offset (a wrong XYOFFSET constant, an
  #    off-by-one in the >>4 truncation, a wrong lane feeding x) would have been invisible
  #    corpus-wide. If either bucket is widened again, re-measure +-1 px FIRST: it is the tightest
  #    of these by an order of magnitude. Dropped geometry, colour errors of 4 steps or more and
  #    shifts of 3 px and up are not close calls -- they fail by 7x-84x either way.
  #
  #    Family C (vu1dump4_prog_165 over B, prog_177 and prog_252 over A) used to SKIP here: its
  #    0x64 / 0x30 / 0x32 render-state packets point TEX0 at a texture the dump does not carry, so
  #    every texel read back 0 and the ALPHA_1 = 0x44 those packets also set -- (Cs - Cd) * As + Cd
  #    with As = 0 -- left the framebuffer untouched. vu1_replay now fills VRAM outside the frame
  #    and z buffers with 0x80808080 (so any TEX0 samples a neutral texel, the same identity
  #    MODULATE family A already got from its parked 1x1) and gives the z buffer its own pages
  #    (those packets also switch TEST from ALWAYS to GEQUAL). vu1dump3_prog_31 is the fourth
  #    family, whose 0x40 draws through the host hook with an untextured PRIM 0x4B.
  #    vu1dump4_prog_182 (the fourth C-over-A dump in the corpus) is in this set as of Sprint 4
  #    task 3. It used to score 1.488% because both by-design buckets were calibrated on opaque,
  #    edge-only differences: 6 of its 9 hard pixels were the blend-amplified delta-2 class and 3
  #    were interior seams at 8, 12 and 14 steps. Note for whoever calibrates the buckets again:
  #    the delta-2 class is partly an artifact of this synthetic context, not of the game's blend
  #    alone, because Cd = 0 on a first write and the neutral texel's At = 128 reduce
  #    (Cs - Cd) * As + Cd to Cv * Av >> 7.
  #    Still a known gap: a patterned rather than uniform neutral fill, which is what a uniform
  #    texel cannot cover -- any ST/UV/Q divergence between the two paths is invisible against a
  #    constant texture.
  #    The run also has to be read, not just exited: vu1_replay warns on stderr when a fixture's
  #    TEX0 resolves below the zeroed framebuffer/z region (see warnIfTextureInBlankRegion), which
  #    degrades that dump's comparison silently -- it can go back to drawing nothing and SKIPping,
  #    which is the one failure mode --vram-diff cannot score. Nothing in the fixture set trips it
  #    today, so the check below costs nothing now and turns that into a hard stop the day a
  #    fixture's texture lands in the blank region. Same shape as expect_native: capture, print,
  #    then assert on the output rather than trusting the exit code alone.

vram diff: the dump named above has a TEX0 that resolves below the zeroed framebuffer/z region,
so it samples 0 and that dump's GIF-vs-host comparison is degraded -- at the limit it draws
nothing and SKIPs, which is exactly the blank-frame hole this check exists to keep closed.
Fix the layout, not this assertion: revisit setupReplayGsContext in
third_party/ps2recomp/ps2xRuntime/src/tools/vu1_replay.cpp and move the replay framebuffer and z
buffer (kZBufferPage / kBlankBytes, and kTextureBlock with them, which the static_assert ties
together) so that the fixture's texture lands in the neutral fill above them.

  # 7: the work-ceiling refusal path. tests/fixtures/vu1/clamp holds vu1dump4_prog_11 with TOP+2.z
  #    rewritten from 76 to 300 -- above kMaxVertices -- and a golden taken from the microcode path
  #    on that patched dump (which runs 5.6M cycles to produce nothing, i.e. exactly the runaway
  #    the ceiling exists to stop). The native path must refuse it: this run has to report
  #    "entered=1 ended=0 handbacks=1" and still match end pc, VU data memory and every register.

  # 8-9: the per-handler clamps. Run 7 exercises the PRE-SCAN's ceiling -- a header above it is
  #    refused whole at 0x1b50 and no handler is ever entered -- so it says nothing about the
  #    clamps inside the handlers. Those cannot be reached with data at all: the pre-scan reads
  #    the same two header words first, and vi10 is bounded by the clipper that produces it. They
  #    are reached instead with the two test-only ceiling overrides, which lower the HANDLER-side
  #    ceilings and leave the pre-scan's real constants alone (socom2_dispatch_0x1b50.cpp:
  #    vertexCeiling / triangleCeiling / clippedVertexCeiling). Nothing in the game sets either.
  #
  #    Both runs check against run 4's own unmodified golden, with no new fixture bytes, because
  #    that is the whole claim: a clamp hand-back has to leave exactly the state the microcode then
  #    finishes the list from, so the end state must be the microcode's to the last register.
  #
  #    8: PS2X_VU1_NATIVE_TEST_CEILING=2 trips cmdUnpackVertices' clamp at 0x0b28 (TOP+2.z is 8..76
  #       across the set) on the FIRST command of all fifteen lists, fourteen of which start
  #       68 and one (the fourth family) 70, whose 0x0cb8 unpack clamps on the same count.
  #    9: PS2X_VU1_NATIVE_TEST_CLIP_CEILING=2 leaves every family-A count alone and trips
  #       cmdClippedTransform's clamp at 0x0f38 (vi10) MID-LIST on the six lists that contain
  #       family-B commands -- after 68/06/02 have run and the clipper has written qwords 40-111,
  #       112 and 329.z and left vi8/vi10/vi12/vi15 live. That is the hand-back research/13 6.3
  #       calls the inside of an indivisible unit, and the one this file's whole-state
  #       reproduction is what makes safe; the other nine (family A, C-over-A and the fourth
  #       family) still run to
  #       their E bit, which is what makes the run a two-sided check rather than a blanket refusal.

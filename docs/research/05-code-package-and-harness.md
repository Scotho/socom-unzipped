# SOCOM II code package, DNAS protection and the Unicorn harness (2026-09-04)

## What is actually the game
`SCUS_972.75` (874 KB, ~350 KB code) is only a **loader**: MSL crt0, libcdvd/libmc/libpad/libdma/libgraph/libipu/libdbc/libusbkb RPC clients, zlib 1.1.4, and `main()` at 0x1c4cc0. The game itself lives in `RUN/RAW/APACHE00.ZDB` (r0001; the r0004 update is the same container downloaded to memory card `BASCUS-97275SOCOMII/APACHE00.ZDB`):

| ZDB entry | encrypted+deflated | plain | Metrowerks `MWo3` overlay | load | text | data | bss | end |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ftscore`  | 855,920 B | 2,233,472 B | `FTSCore.bin` (v1)  | 0x1e7000 | 0x1f4fb8 | 0x2c3d0 | 0xacf00 | 0x4b5380 |
| `zsealetc` | 691,792 B | 1,723,520 B | `ZSealEtc.bin` (v3) | 0x4c5380 | 0x18a3b8 | 0x1a880 | 0x1cf80 | 0x686f80 |

Overlay header (0x80 bytes): `MWo3`, version, load address, text size, data size, bss size, ctor table start/end, name at +0x20. The file is loaded verbatim, so code starts at load+0x80. `OVERLAY/REL/DNAS.BIN` (libdnas2 2.7.1 + libhttp + OpenSSL-derived crypto) shares the 0x4c5380 slot and is only resident during authentication/decryption; ZSealEtc replaces it afterwards. Boot then jumps to **0x4c53c0** (ZSealEtc entry) with argc/argv.

Recovered build id: `SOCOM 2 r0001 17:22:21 Oct 11 2003`. Compiler: MW MIPS C 2.4.1.01 (CodeWarrior). No symbols, but Metrowerks RTTI class names survive (`CZSealBody`, `CZFTSWeapon`, ...), as do thousands of strings (rdr/zar names, UI events, Medius API names) matching the reCOM SOCOM 1 symbol set.

Network stack inside ZSealEtc: SCE-RT **DME client 1.32.0070**, `rt_udp 01.02.0048`, `rt_audio` (voice), `rt_crypt` (LargeInt RSA, MD5), **Medius Client Library 1.50.0013**; hostnames `socom2-prod.pdonline.scea.com` and `socom2-prod.muis.pdonline.scea.com`; sceHTTP for the patch download.

## DNAS protection (libdnas2 "content decryption")
Decryption sequence (mirrors `FUN_001c5da0` in the loader), all functions in DNAS.BIN:
```
0x534830()                              init (creates semaphores; needs sceSifInitRpc + sceCdInit first)
rc    = 0x539d00(size, buf, &out)       parse+verify 0x580-byte signed header, RSA/MD5; >= 0
size2 = 0x539d50(size, out, buf)        decrypt body in place (3DES-CBC-ish, chunked 0x80); > 0
rc    = 0x534848(size2, buf, &n)        second-layer decrypt (dnas "unique" layer);  == 0
rc    = 0x535018(size2, n, buf)         finalize;                                    == 0
inflate(buf[:n]) -> overlay             zlib
```
Step 2 asks the IOP CDVD S-command server (SIF RPC SID 0x80000593) for `sceCdReadConsoleID` (fno 0x24) and `sceCdMV` (fno 0x26). **Any values work** (the IDs feed a hash that is not verified against the content), so the package is not console-locked.

Anti-tamper: DNAS.BIN self-encrypts **131 code blocks** (0x7578 bytes). Each protected function begins `if (!flag) DECRYPT(start, size^key, key, flags)` and ends with the matching re-encrypt; four copies of the decryptor exist (0x4ee9e8, 0x52b9d0, 0x53a358, 0x5412a0). The cipher is a chain of ≤7 word-transforms (xor / rotate / byte-swap) selected by nibbles of a descriptor derived from `key`, skipping relocation words listed in a per-block table. `tools_py/dnas_selfdecrypt.py` decrypts all blocks statically by running each variant's core routine under Unicorn → `DNAS.dec.bin` (+ `DNAS.blocks.json`).

## The harness (`tools_py/ee_unicorn.py`)
Unicorn MIPS64 LE (cpu model MIPS64R2 generic; the default R4000 rejects `movn` etc.). R5900-only encodings (MMI, lq/sq, 3-op mult, mult1/div1, mtsab/mtsah, R5900 FPU adda/madd/max/min/rsqrt, cache/pref/sync.x, COP0) are trap-patched to `syscall` with an index and emulated in Python; 128-bit upper halves live Python-side. Lessons that cost time:
- A trapped instruction in a **branch delay slot** must be handled by trapping the *branch* instead (QEMU misreports the PC).
- Do **not** install memory-read hooks over code regions — it breaks Unicorn's translator (host access violations). A cheap global code hook is needed for stability when guest code writes to code pages.
- After an HLE-replaced function returns, resume with a fresh `emu_start` at `$ra` (writing PC inside the hook leaves stale branch state → spurious RI exceptions).
- Key/flag constants and re-encrypt trailer constants live *inside* `.text`; they must never be trap-patched.
- The overlay region is inside the loader ELF's bss: run crt0 first, then load overlays (as `main()` does).
- `ee_sema_t.init_count` is at +8. `t_SifClientData.server` is at +0x24.
- Map uncached mirrors 0x20000000/0x30000000 onto the same RAM buffer (`mem_map_ptr`).

HLE provided: kernel semaphores/threads (single-threaded), `SetupThread/SetupHeap`, `sceSifBindRpc/CallRpc/CheckStatRpc`, SIF regs/DMA, cdvd S-cmd server. `decrypt_apache.py` runs end-to-end in ~5 min (Python emulation of the 3DES layers dominates) and writes `game/overlays/{ftscore,zsealetc}.bin`; `make_overlay_elf.py` wraps loader + both overlays into `game/overlays/socom2_game.elf` (3 PT_LOADs, entry 0x180008).

## PS2Recomp with llvm-mingw
Builds except the final `ps2EntryRunner` link: raylib's `CloseWindow`/`ShowCursor` collide with user32 (MSVC gets `/FORCE:MULTIPLE`). Fix when forking: build raylib with `-DSUPPORT_...` renames or link with `-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition`. `ps2_analyzer.exe` and `ps2_recomp.exe` built fine.

## SIF RPC servers the game binds (from the recovered code)
| SID | Module | Bound by |

The engine builds its own disc TOC by reading ISO9660 sectors (starting at LBN 16) through `sceCdRead`, then reads all files by LBN: the runtime must serve raw sectors from the ISO (`IoPaths.cdImage`).
On fatal init errors FTSCore calls `LoadExecPS2("cdrom0:\SCUS_972.75;1", 3, {"--menu_state", "dlgAfterErrorReboot.rdr", ""})` — a self-relaunch with arguments parsed by the loader's `main()`.

## Reference boot on PCSX2 2.8.1 (BIOS 0200a, `logs/pcsx2_reference_boot.txt`)
Loader (t≈4 s): IOP reboot with DNAS271.IMG, then `SIO2MAN, CDVDSTM, SIO2D, DBCMAN, DS2U_S1, MCMAN, MCSERV`; PCSX2 patches a timeout loop at 0x1b3a10 (libmc). Game code (t≈12.5 s, after APACHE00 decryption): `USB\USBD.IRX hub=1`, `USB\USBKB.IRX`, `DEV9.IRX`, `LIBSD.IRX`, `SOUND\989SND.IRX stream_priority=18`, `SOUND\989DSTRM.IRX`, `LGAUD.IRX`, `HEADSETO.IRX priority=22` ("HEADSET Output module v2.0 built with liblgaud 1.08 and SCE 2.8.0"). First VU0 microprogram at t≈18 s, first VU1 microprogram at t≈33 s (intro rendering).

## Two loader traps (found 2026-09-04 morning)
1. The loader's crt0 zero-fills `0x1d5600..0x686f80` (its bss, which *contains* both overlay slots) before `main()`. Any overlay image placed by an ELF loader is wiped; the real game reloads them from the ZDB afterwards. Fix: recomp instruction patch at 0x180120/0x180128 (bss end -> 0x1e7000) plus the override re-copies the overlay segments from the ELF file.
2. Metrowerks overlays keep their static-constructor thunks (`__sinit_*`, 125 in FTSCore at 0x3fd680.., 16 in ZSealEtc at 0x668480..) **after rodata, inside the "data" part** of the `MWo3` image, past the header's text size. The loader runs them via `FUN_00182840(ctor_start, ctor_end)` (header +0x18/+0x1c). The synthetic ELF must therefore keep the whole overlay image executable, and the override runs the tables through `EeScheduler::invokeCurrentSequence`.

## Recompiler pitfall: non-contiguous Ghidra functions
`ExportPS2Functions.java` writes `Start, End(=body max address), Size(=body byte count)`. A Ghidra function whose body has several address ranges (shared epilogues, split blocks) gets `End - Start != Size`; `FUN_00198830` came out as `0x198830..0x1a42f8` (size 28) and the recompiler registered every interior address of that 46 KB range (strtok_r, string/SIF helpers...) as labels of that one function, so calls into the range resumed at a wrong `switch(pc)` default and returned garbage (`strtok` loop hang in the path builder at 0x39ee50). Fix: post-process the CSV so `End = Start + Size` (done in build flow), and force extra entry points from `recomp/extra_functions.txt`.

## Function discovery, third pass: immediate-referenced callbacks
Alarm/interrupt handlers and thread entries are passed as `lui/addiu` immediates, so neither flow analysis nor the data pointer scan sees them (e.g. the 16-byte alarm handler at 0x34f120 that wakes the main thread after `SetAlarm(0x7b0c, ...)`, sitting between two Ghidra functions). `tools_py/find_imm_targets.py` scans executable segments for materialized addresses that no function covers and appends them to `recomp/extra_functions.txt`, which `fix_ghidra_csv.py` folds into the map at build time (1,463 candidates on the first run; false positives become unreachable garbage functions, which is harmless).

## Engine rendering path: scratchpad MFIFO (found 2026-09-05)
zSys builds VIF1 packets in scratchpad and pushes them into a 512 KB RAM ring (`D_RBOR=0x100000`, `D_RBSR=0x7fff0`) with DMA channel 8 (fromSPR, kicked by a byte write to `D8_CHCR+1`). VIF1 is started once in chain mode (`D1_CHCR=0x145`, `D1_TADR=ring start`) with `D_CTRL.MFD=2`, so the DMAC drains the ring (memory FIFO) and stalls whenever `D1_TADR == D8_MADR`. `zSysFifoKick` (FUN_00350ab0) polls `D1_TADR` / `D8_MADR` for free space. PS2Recomp had no D8/D9 channels and no MFIFO; added in `ps2_memory.cpp` (`runSprDma`, `kickMfifoDrain`, ring-wrapped tag/data reads, stall keeps STR set). GIF (`MFD=3`) is handled the same way for the GS path (`FUN_00350e30(2)`).

## Boot reaches the frame loop; next blocker = frame-loop threading (2026-09-05)
After the RSA-keygen stub, lgaud device enumeration (report "no device" for non-init RPCs), and the first 989snd bank load from the ISO, the engine enters its render frame loop and deadlocks:
- **main thread** spins in `zVid_Swap`→`FUN_00350e30(1)` on `while (REG_VIF1_CHCR & 0x100)` — waiting for the VIF1 MFIFO chain to drain.
- **render thread** (`FUN_003b1dd0`, created by `FUN_003b2450`, entry FUN_003b1dd0) is asleep in `SleepThread`; it is the producer that fills the scratchpad→ring FIFO.
Root cause is a model mismatch, not a single bug: PS2Recomp's EE scheduler is cooperative (switches on syscalls/backward-edge checkpoints) and DMA is synchronous, so a CPU busy-wait on an MMIO status bit cannot be unblocked by another guest thread producing the data. Needs one of: (a) the render thread woken (check the VBLANK INTC handler path — `FUN_001a49d0`/`_iWakeupThread`, and whether the scheduler's VBlank actually runs the game's handler); (b) treat a stalled-MFIFO CHCR.STR poll as a yield point so the scheduler runs the producer; or (c) make MFIFO drain opportunistically when fromSPR advances (already done) plus let an empty-ring VIF1 chain that has no pending producer *complete* rather than stall on the first frame. This is the first genuinely scheduler-level issue and is the top task for M2→M3.

## Frame-loop threading, refined (2026-09-05 later)
The render thread (`FUN_003b1dd0`, thread 2) is woken ONLY by the EE INTC VIF1 interrupt (cause 5): the game does `AddIntcHandler(5, 0x33c010)` (`FUN_0033bcd0`) and `FUN_0033c010` calls `iWakeupThread(render)`. Implemented raising INTC cause 5 when the VIF1 interpreter hits an interrupt-marked VIFcode (memory→runtime `queueIntcCause`/`consumePendingIntcCauses` → `EeScheduler::dispatchIrq(false,5)`; committed). Necessary but not sufficient: still deadlocked at frame 0 because the render thread produces the VIF1 data, so nothing raises INTC-5 until it has already run — a bootstrap gap. Next: find who issues the first render-thread wake during engine init (before the swap loop) — likely a direct VIF1/GS setup packet pushed by the main thread with an interrupt bit, or a one-shot wake near `FUN_003b1200`/`FUN_003b2450`. Diagnostic to add: log every `dispatchIrq`, `WakeupThread`/`SleepThread` (with thread id), and VIF1 `CHCR` write for the first 3 s. Note the MFIFO stall (keep CHCR.STR set on empty ring) is correct only when the producer has written an end tag; at frame boundaries the chain ends cleanly, so the stall itself is not the bug.

## MFIFO ring-pointer bug — precise lead (2026-09-05, PS2X_TRACE_FIFO)
Traced the DMAC. Fixed one real bug: `writeIORegister` only acted on CHCR-start writes and never stored other DMAC registers, so RBOR/RBSR read back as 0 (commit "persist all DMAC-region registers"). After that, the *initial* ring pointers are correct: first VIF1 MFIFO start shows `tadr=0x00100000`, first fromSPR shows `madr=0x00100000` (= RBOR). But after the first drain/kick BOTH collapse to `0x0007fff0` (= RBSR) and then `tagAddr == D8_MADR` forever ⇒ `stalled=1`, `tags=0`, `chainBytes=0`, so no VIF1 data flows, no INTC-5, render/display thread never wakes → deadlock at `zVid_Swap`/0x350e78.
The wrap math is `ringWrap(a) = RBOR + ((a - RBOR) & RBSR)` (ps2_memory.cpp ~1301) and the fromSPR advance is `madr = RBOR + ((madr + 16 - RBOR) & RBSR)` (~1898). With RBOR=0x100000, RBSR=0x7fff0, neither should produce 0x7fff0 from 0x100000 — value 0x7fff0 = RBSR appears only as `X & RBSR` WITHOUT `+RBOR`, i.e. RBOR reads 0 *inside the wrap* even though it's 0x100000 at CHCR-write time. Next step: add rbor/rbsr to the runSprDma trace (the last attempt's format-string edit failed to compile cleanly — re-add carefully) and to ringWrap, to see whether RBOR is 0 there (write-ordering / a second code path writing RBOR after the register is read) or whether the qwc loop over-runs. The `[fifo]` trace (PS2X_TRACE_FIFO=1) and the CHCR-write dump are already in place.

# Pictures in the story — the inventory (spec §5.3)

One row per image `docs/STORY.md` shows. Every picture is a frame the project's own program produced, at the
resolution it runs, uncropped except to remove a desktop; none is an asset lifted out of the disc. A video row is the same thing at
length: a screen recording of the program's own windows, cropped to remove the desktop and cut down, with a poster frame beside it. The four that were
already tracked under `docs/research/assets/` are copied here so the story has one published path. This table is
also the input to Sprint 11 Goal 1's disc-derived decision table and Goal 5's accreditation inventory. **The line is
the owner's** (spec §9 Q1); `tools_py/story/cite.py` only keeps this list and the document in step.

*(2026-09-25: `2026-09-14-grey-hill-before.png` was an **orphan row** — a row for a picture `docs/STORY.md` no
longer showed, which `tools_py/story/cite.py` cannot catch because it only checks the other direction. It is the
"before" half of the brighten pair whose "after" was already shown, so it is restored to the 2026-09-16 hands-on
entry — the sitting where the owner saw that hillside; the brighten entry already has its one picture, which spec
§5.3 caps — and its Entry column corrected. The counts and the byte total above already included it and are
unchanged.)*

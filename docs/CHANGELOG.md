# Changelog: the merges, by release tag

> **Generated -- do not edit.** Written by `python -m tools_py.changelog` from `git log` (R272): every merge commit on the first-parent line of the history it was rendered from, and on the first-parent line of each branch those merges brought in, grouped by the oldest `v*` tag that contains it. `python -m tools_py.changelog --check` exits 1 when this file is stale; regenerate at every merge to a sprint branch (in the merge's follow-up commit) and at the close. The rules are the module's docstring. The reasoning behind a merge is its commit message and the sprint plan's Log; the hand-written log this page replaced is `docs/archive/STATUS-log-to-2026-09-26.md`.

142 merges (39 on the first-parent line, 103 from the branches they merged) in 10 sections: 9 tags and the merges since the newest. Each line: the date, the merge commit, the head of its subject, [the branch it merged]. An indented line came in on the branch the line above it merged.

## Since v0.13.0

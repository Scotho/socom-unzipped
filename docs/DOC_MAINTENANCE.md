# Documentation maintenance — the classes, the registry, and the sprint-close review

**Last full review: 2026-09-26 (Sprint 13 close; §5 by a read-only agent's table, 24 findings fixed; §7 by a read-only agent's table, the audit clean, acted on in S13-R12 and S13-R14).** Next: at the next sprint's close, by its controller.

> **The first review under this schema, 2026-09-23 (Sprint 10's close), and what it changed.** Step 1: `docmaint`
> OK. Step 2: every L document read for truth by a read-only agent against the tree and the night's ledgers — 56
> findings (README 4, STATUS 4, KNOWN 8, CURRENT_SPRINT 9, HANDOFF 13, HUMAN_TASKS 10, DEVELOPING 2, ROADMAP 4,
> STORY 2, PICTURES 0), every one applied with supersede-in-place (`70759da`, `7a89b8c`, `80e0074`, `37f9bb0`),
> reviewed (four sentence-level Importants, all fixed: `1d86d71`, `ae13cf8`, `dec9af9`, `5aef282`), re-reviewed
> clean. Step 3: README's table rewritten row by row against KNOWN. Step 4: ROADMAP had already regrown a task list
> (its eight-item backlog) one day after the rewrite — moved to CURRENT_SPRINT's filler list; STORY's closing beat
> answered under a dated blockquote. Step 5: nothing archived this time. The sprint's 64 rulings (R181–R244, R229
> deliberately vacant) reconciled into one table in CURRENT_SPRINT. Two lessons for the schema: (1) a class-N
> document regrows live state within a day if the author does not have a filler list to put it in — CURRENT_SPRINT
> now has one; (2) counts must carry their date *and* the same artefact must carry the same number in every row
> (the same capture was "21 minutes" and "twelve-minute" three lines apart).

## 0. Why this exists

On 2026-09-22 `docs/ROADMAP.md` was audited against the tree for the first time since it was written. Nine of its
twenty-five checkable claims still held; two were **wrong in a way that would misdirect an agent** — it told readers to
reorder the standing goals in `LOOP_PROMPT.md`, a file that had been rewritten two days earlier to contain no goals at
all, and it described a knob problem that Sprint 10 had solved. The same pass found three more:

- **`docs/HANDOFF.md` offered "Next free ruling number: **R179**" while R241 was in use.** Not merely stale — an
  agent obeying it would have collided with sixty-two existing rulings, and `docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md` already records
  that exact failure happening once ("the agent numbered from R200, already taken").
- **`README.md`, the public front page, listed "terrain holes (root cause still open) and a water defect on one map"**
  — both fixed on 2026-09-16, six days before the README's own last edit. It understated the project to strangers.
- **`docs/HANDOFF.md` and `docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md` both carried the suite baselines `C++ 686/686, Python 1457 OK` on 2026-09-22** —
  true when written on 2026-09-20, four sprints stale by then, and the third and fourth places in the tree to
  hard-code a number that `docs/DEVELOPING.md` already owns. (That sentence keeps its date *on the same line as the
  number*, which is exactly what check 3 asks for.)
- **The ruling counter had two homes that disagreed**: `HANDOFF.md` said the next free number was R242 and
  `CURRENT_SPRINT.md` said R241, while R240 was the highest actually in use.

The documents that stayed true and the ones that rotted did not differ in care. `docs/KNOWN.md` is audited after every
task and stayed true for ten days across six sprints. `ROADMAP.md` was audited by nobody. **The difference is whether
anything could fail.** This file is the schema; `tools_py/docmaint.py` and `tools_py/tests/test_doc_maintenance.py`
are the thing that fails.

## 1. The six classes

Every perpetuating document has exactly one class. The class decides **what may be written in it** and **when it is
checked** — and the first of those matters more, because a document with nothing perishable in it cannot rot.

| Class | Meaning | What it may contain | Checked |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L** — Live | Must be true *right now*; read by every session | Current state, open items, live numbers | **After every task that changes it**, and in full at sprint close |
| **G** — Generated | A tool writes it from a source of truth | Whatever the tool emits — never hand-edited | By its own test, every suite run |
| **N** — Narrative | History, reasoning and pointers | **No live state, no live numbers, no task lists.** Pointers to L documents instead | Sprint close |
| **S** — Snapshot | Frozen at its date | Anything — it is a record of one moment | Never. It is not updated; it is superseded |
| **C** — Contract | Rules that change only by decision | Process, policy, templates | Sprint close, against what actually happens |
| **A** — Archive | Superseded, kept because things cite it | The original text, verbatim, under a banner | Never |

**The rule that does the most work is N's.** The roadmap rotted because it held live state — sprint task lists, test
counts, frame rates, an instruction to go and edit another file. A narrative document that says *"the live queue is
`docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md`"* cannot be wrong about the queue. Prefer moving a fact to its owning L document and pointing
at it over repeating it.

**S and A are not failures.** A dated snapshot that says what it is costs nothing and is often the most valuable thing
in the tree. The failure mode is a snapshot that *reads as current* — which is why both classes must announce
themselves, and why the checks below enforce exactly that and nothing else about their content.

## 2. What the registry covers

The table in §3 must account for every `.md` file in these locations, one row each:

- the repository root: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/*.md`, `docs/parity/*.md`, `docs/story/*.md`, `docs/archive/*.md`

Everything else is classified **by location**, and needs no row:

- `docs/archive/<subdirectory>/**` — **A**. `docs/archive/*.md` at the top level is one document each and gets a row
  each; a subdirectory is a *block* moved whole (`docs/archive/sprints-1-6/` is twelve files that arrived in one
  commit), and a row apiece would say nothing the path does not. **The banner is still owed** — that is the whole
  point of the class, and `tools_py/docmaint.py`'s check 5 holds every file under such a subdirectory to it.
- `docs/research/**` — **S**. A research note is a dated investigation. Supersede, never rewrite.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/**` and `plans/**` — **S**. A spec is what was decided that day; the plan's `## Outcome`
  is where it is reconciled. Their filenames carry the date already.
- `docs/audits/**` — **S**, dated in the filename by convention.
- `third_party/**`, `server/horizon-server/**` — vendored. Not ours to maintain; do not edit to match our tree.
- `tools_py/**/README.md`, `tests/fixtures/**/README.md` — **S**, owned by the fixture or tool beside them.

A new document in a covered location with no row **fails the suite**. That is the point: the registry is how a
document gets a class, and an unclassified document is one nobody has decided the rules for.

## 3. The registry

| Path | Class | Owner | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | **L** | controller | The public front page. Its "Works / Not yet" table is a live claim and is the highest-stakes row here — a stranger reads it before anything else |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | **C** | controller | |
| `SECURITY.md` | **C** | controller | The "Known: the game's own network code" section is live in spirit; review it whenever the network path changes |
| `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` | **G** | licence test | A test fails on a dependency, vendored directory or release DLL without a row |
| `CLAUDE.md` | **C** | controller | Loaded into every Claude Code session at start. A map, never state: at most 60 lines, no suite count, the live documents and the four skill names named (`ClaudeMdTest`). Sprint 14 I1 |
| `docs/STATUS.md` | **L** | controller | **Only the "Current state" block is live.** Everything under it is a dated log, newest first, and is class S by paragraph — an entry keeps the numbers it was written with, on purpose. This is why STATUS is exempt from the single-source count rule |
| `docs/KNOWN.md` | **L** | every task | Proven vs believed, with the artefact for each. **It wins on any disagreement.** The model this schema is generalised from |
| `docs/HAZARDS.md` | **L** | every task | The standing hazards by the area each bites -- KNOWN's section 4 until 2026-09-26 (R270, Sprint 14 I5). A hazard is a trap, not a claim; retired in place, never deleted; KNOWN wins on any disagreement |
| `docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md` | **L** | controller | The live queue and the road to the next tag |
| `docs/HANDOFF.md` | **L** | controller | What a new controller reads first. Holds the **ruling counter**, checked mechanically |
| `docs/HUMAN_TASKS.md` | **L** | controller | The owner's queue |
| `docs/DEVELOPING.md` | **L** | controller | **Owns the suite counts.** No other registered document may state them |
| `docs/INSTALL.md` | **L** | controller | The player's setup page. Live because it quotes the launcher's own sentences and describes a download that does not exist yet — the "get the archive" paragraph changes the day the distribution decision is answered |
| `docs/FAQ.md` | **L** | controller | The player's failure page. Every exit-code sentence is quoted from `ps2x/exit_codes.h`; a change to that table changes this file |
| `docs/story/PICTURES.md` | **L** | story | The inventory of what `STORY.md` shows; the citation test keeps them honest |
| `docs/KNOBS.md` | **G** | `tools_py.knobs` | Generated from `ps2x/knobs.h`; a test fails on a stale row, an unregistered read or a row nothing reads |
| `docs/LADDER.md` | **G** | `ladder_ledger.py` | One row per scheduled ladder run, written from `logs/ladder/ledger.jsonl`, committed by a person |
| `docs/BACKLOG.md` | **G** | `tools_py.issues backlog` | The carry's one home (R267): the open issues with their milestone, carried count and closing bar, then `docs/backlog_ruled_out.txt` as a second table. Regenerated and committed at every sprint close (§7 step 5) and whenever the list changes; `backlog --check` exits 1 on a stale file, and the docs test runs its `--offline` half |
| `docs/backlog_ruled_out.txt` | **L** | controller | Not a markdown file, registered because it is the source `docs/BACKLOG.md` renders: one row per unfinished item ruled not to be an issue, with its ruling (an R-number or `no issue`) and its bar. A row leaves it when it becomes an issue or a task |
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | **N** | controller | Narrative and pointers only. Rewritten 2026-09-22; its §0 is the audit of what it replaced |
| `docs/STORY.md` | **N** | story | Every entry cited; `tools_py/story/cite.py` fails on a dead hash or an unwitnessed run |
| `docs/HOW_IT_WAS_BUILT.md` | **N** | controller | How the project was made, for a stranger: the method, the owner's share and the agents', and the process failures worth keeping. Pointers only — the live documents own every current number. `README.md` links it |
| `docs/GIT_STRATEGY.md` | **C** | controller | Branches, slices, releases. Carries the sprint-close step that invokes this file |
| `docs/LOOP_PROMPT.md` | **C** | controller | **A pointer since 2026-09-26** (Sprint 14 I2): under 2,000 bytes, naming the four skills in `.claude/skills/` that hold the procedure now (`SkillsTest` holds both). Carries no state at all — the model for C. Rewritten 2026-09-20 after the old one aimed the loop at Sprint 6 for six days |
| `docs/PLAYTEST.md` | **C** | controller | The owner's one-sitting script |
| `docs/DOC_MAINTENANCE.md` | **C** | controller | This file |
| `docs/story/release-entry.template.md` | **C** | story | A template |
| `docs/parity/REPORT.md` | **S** | — | One parity run from 2026-09-07. Banded 2026-09-22 — it had read as the project's parity status for fifteen days |
| `docs/parity/NOTES.md` | **S** | — | Dated spike notes, append-only |
| `docs/archive/README.md` | **A** | — | |
| `docs/archive/ROADMAP-sprint-4-to-sprint-7.md` | **A** | — | Fifteen files cite it; every `ROADMAP.md §N` written before 2026-09-22 means this file |
| `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-to-sprint-8.md` | **A** | — | |
| `docs/archive/LOOP_PROMPT-to-2026-09-26.md` | **A** | — | Cut 2026-09-26 (Sprint 14 I2): `docs/LOOP_PROMPT.md` verbatim before it became a pointer, superseded by the four skills. Every "LOOP_PROMPT step N", "Every iteration" or "Lock protocol" cited before that day means this file |
| `docs/archive/HANDOFF-loop-history-to-2026-09-25.md` | **A** | — | Cut 2026-09-25 (Sprint 13 Task R1, R268): HANDOFF §2's older pick-up points, §4 and §10, verbatim |
| `docs/archive/HUMAN_TASKS-to-2026-09-25.md` | **A** | — | Cut 2026-09-25 (Sprint 13 Task R4): the owner's queue before it became one table, verbatim, under a disposition for each of its 87 items. Every HUMAN_TASKS section, item or line cited before that day means this file |
| `docs/archive/KNOWN-section-4-to-2026-09-26.md` | **A** | — | Cut 2026-09-26 (Sprint 14 Task I5, R270): KNOWN's section 4, the 104 standing hazards, verbatim as they stood at the split. Every "KNOWN §4" written before that day resolves to `docs/HAZARDS.md` by headline, or to this file as it was |
| `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-sprints-9-to-11.md` | **A** | — | Cut 2026-09-25 (Sprint 13 Task R1, R268): the Sprint 9-11 records, verbatim. The ruling counter reads it (`max_ruling()` scans all of `docs/archive/`) |
| `docs/archive/HANDOFF-reference-to-2026-09-13.md` | **A** | — | |
| `docs/archive/HANDOFF-2026-09-08.md` | **A** | — | Banded 2026-09-22 |
| `docs/archive/HANDOFF-AUDIT-2026-09-14.md` | **A** | — | Banded 2026-09-22 |

## 4. What is enforced mechanically

`tools_py/tests/test_doc_maintenance.py`, in the Python suite, so it runs in CI and needs no build. Ten checks, each
aimed at a rot mechanism that actually bit this project (the seventh and eighth are R268's, the ninth and tenth
Sprint 13 Task R3's, all added 2026-09-25):

1. **Registry completeness** — every covered file has exactly one row; every row points at a file that exists. *Catches
   a new document nobody classified, and a row left behind by a move.*
2. **The ruling counter** — `docs/HANDOFF.md`'s "Next free ruling number: R\<n\>" must be exactly `max(R<n>) + 1` over
   the live documents. *Catches the R179-against-R241 collision, which had already happened once.*
3. **Single-source suite counts** — `Total Tests: <n>`, `Ran <n> tests` and `<n>/<n>` baselines may appear only in
   `docs/DEVELOPING.md`. S and A documents are exempt (they are records), and `docs/STATUS.md` is exempt by the §3
   note. *Catches the 686/686 defect, in all four places it had reached.*
4. **Snapshots are dated** — every S file has a date in its filename or in its first fifteen lines. *Catches a
   `REPORT.md` that reads as the current report.*
5. **Archives announce themselves** — every A file says "archived" or "superseded" in its first fifteen lines, in any
   case. *Catches an archive that reads as live.*
6. **No dangling `docs/` path** — every backticked path starting `docs/` in a markdown file at the root or under
   `docs/` must exist in the tree. *Catches the citation a move left pointing at nothing* — which is why the Sprint 1–6
   specs and plans sat under `docs/superpowers/` for a sprint after they were dead: nobody could move them without
   breaking citations nothing would catch. It found 44 on the tree the day it was written, in fifteen documents.
7. **Ceilings on the appending documents (R268)** -- `docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md`, the "## 2." section of
   `docs/HANDOFF.md`, the "## Current state" block of `docs/STATUS.md` and `docs/HUMAN_TASKS.md` each have a byte
   ceiling (`CEILINGS` in `tools_py/docmaint.py`, counted with LF line ends; the failure prints the measured size). A
   measured heading that has gone fires too, so renaming it cannot switch the ceiling off. *Catches the stack nobody
   retires:* on 2026-09-25 the sprint file was 190 KB with about 12 % of it live, HANDOFF §2 held twelve pick-up
   points and three of them said "now", and STATUS's "keep it short" block was 30 KB. The ceilings were set at that
   day's split (Sprint 13 Task R1) with about 25 % headroom. **When one fires, archive the oldest blocks** (a banner,
   a registry row, the citations re-pointed) -- never raise the number to make it pass; a lower number after a cut
   (Task R4 for HUMAN_TASKS) is the only edit it expects.
8. **"merged to `main` as `vX.Y.Z`" names a tag origin has (R268)** -- every such phrase in an L document is checked
   against `git ls-remote --tags origin`; a struck-through claim is a retraction and is skipped. *Catches a close
   recorded before it happened:* on 2026-09-25 four live documents said Sprint 11 was merged as `v0.11.0` while no such
   tag or merge existed, so nobody was prompted to do either. It needs the network: when origin cannot be reached the
   check is **skipped out loud** (`python -m tools_py.docmaint` prints `tags: SKIPPED` with the reason, and the unit
   test reports a skip), never passed silently.
9. **One number, one ruling (Sprint 13 R3)** -- no ruling number is *defined* twice; the failure prints every
   location. *Catches the collision the counter cannot see:* check 2 proves only that the next number is free, and on
   2026-09-25 the audit found R107, R109 and R110 each issued by two Sprint 8 plans for unrelated decisions (and this
   check found R108 issued twice inside one of them). A second issue is **recorded, not renumbered**: its definition
   line carries "cited as R\<n\>b", the check counts that line as R\<n\>b, and every citation that means it says R\<n\>b.
10. **A cited ruling has a text (Sprint 13 R3)** -- every R\<n\> (and R\<n\>b) cited in the documents check 2 reads,
   up to the highest in use, has a definition, a ledger row, or a vacancy note `R<n> -- vacant: <reason>` in the plan
   or ledger that owns its range. *Catches a decision nobody can find to overturn:* R114, R116 and R124 were cited for
   a week with no findable text; the check also found R112, R113 and R139 in the same state.

**What counts as a definition (checks 9 and 10).** A line in a document where a ruling is *made* -- HANDOFF §5 rule 9:
a plan's rulings, or `docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md` when there is no plan, and what `docs/archive/` keeps of both -- in a
house shape: `- **R107** (Task 1): ...`, `**R181 -- ...**`, `- **R169 — ...`, `1. **R237, ...`, a list
`- **R265**, **R266** (...)`, or a bold label anywhere on the line, `**R173:**`, `**Ruling R115: ...`, `**R264** (date,
who): ...`. A citation is not one: `R107's`, `(R107)`, `see **R107**`, `**R238 was wrong**`, `chosen by **R143**:`, a
bold range `**R241–R245**`, a quoted line (`> ...`, where a rewritten ruling keeps its first telling) or a code fence.
A restatement elsewhere (HUMAN_TASKS's summary of the plan's rulings) is not one either. A ledger row (`| R181 | ... |`)
*indexes* a definition: it answers check 10 on its own (R209 and R229 have only their rows) and two rows for one number
fire check 9, but a row beside its plan's bullet is not a duplicate. `S12-R<n>` is Sprint 12's own namespace (R264) and
is not R\<n\>.

`max_ruling()` (check 2) reads every file under `docs/archive/`, top level and subdirectories, as well as the live
documents and the plans: a ruling does not stop existing when its block is archived, and a counter that dropped the
newest archived ledger would walk backwards.

**Check 6's exception, and its scope.** A path that does not exist *yet* is legitimate in a plan or a design: put
`<!-- docmaint: future -->` on that line and the check skips it, so the exception is visible in the document itself
rather than in a list somewhere. A struck-through path (`~~`…`~~`) is a retraction and is skipped too. The scan is
deliberately narrow, because a check with false positives gets switched off: a locator is not part of the path
(`docs/KNOWN.md:101` cites a place inside a file that does exist), a glob or a `<placeholder>` names a set rather than
a file, and a token whose last segment has no extension is a directory or the house shorthand for a research note by
number (`docs/research/19`) — a directory named in a design document is a proposal, not a claim. Check 6 is about a
file that moved.

Run it by hand with `python -m tools_py.docmaint`, which prints the registry size, the ruling numbers and every problem.

**Each check is fired once against a planted defect** (`PlantedDefectsTest`: an unregistered document, a row whose file
is gone, a colliding ruling number, two counter lines that disagree, an undated count, an undated snapshot, a silent
archive, a silent file in an archive subdirectory, a dangling `docs/` path in a `docs/` file and in a root file, a ruling
defined twice, a cited ruling with no text — plus
the negative controls that must *not* fire, and a clean-tree control for the controls). A gate
that has never failed is not known to work, and this one found two real defects and one bug in its own test on the day
it was written.

**A limitation, stated rather than hidden.** Check 3 guarantees a count has *one home and a date*; it cannot tell
whether the number in that home is still right — the only way to know is to run the suite, which is §5 step 2's job.
This was demonstrated the hour the check was written — on 2026-09-22 the suite came back `Ran 1832 tests` while
`DEVELOPING.md` still carried the previous day's number. That is why the Python row now says **`OK`, with no failures, is the bar** and treats
the count as a dated fact that only grows. Prefer a bar a reader can check over a number they must match.

**One check lives outside the suite on purpose.** `python -m tools_py.issues audit` holds the known-issue stack on
GitHub to the live documents (§7; the conventions are `docs/GIT_STRATEGY.md` §7). It needs the network and the
owner's `gh` login, so it is not a unit test: its logic is tested by `tools_py/tests/test_issues.py` on planted stacks
and saved listings, and its run is a step -- before any commit that touches the stack or a `docs/KNOWN.md` row, and in full at the sprint close.

**What is deliberately *not* enforced.** Nothing here fails on a calendar. A test that reddens because a week has
passed gets disabled within a fortnight, and a disabled check is worse than no check because it reads as coverage.
Cadence is §5, a human step with a stamp. Likewise, "an N document contains no live state" is only half mechanical —
the count half is check 3; the rest is a reading, and §5 is where it happens.

## 5. The sprint-close review

**A sprint does not close until this has run and its result is written into the close-out commit.** It is a step in
`docs/GIT_STRATEGY.md`'s close-out, not an optional tidy. Budget: under an hour; it is mostly reading.

1. **`python -m tools_py.docmaint`** — exit 0. If it fails, fix the document, not the check.
2. **Every L document, read for truth**, in this order — `KNOWN.md` (it is audited per task, so this is a spot check),
   `CURRENT_SPRINT.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `HUMAN_TASKS.md`, `STATUS.md`'s Current state block, `DEVELOPING.md`,
   `README.md`. For each, three questions: *is every claim still true; is anything the sprint closed still listed as
   open; is anything the sprint opened missing?*
3. **`README.md` gets its own pass**, because it is the only one a stranger reads and the only one where being *behind*
   is as damaging as being wrong. Walk the "Works / Not yet" table row by row against `KNOWN.md`.
4. **Every N document, read for live state that has crept in.** A number, a task list, a "next", an instruction to go
   and edit another file: move it to its L document and leave a pointer.
5. **Anything superseded this sprint moves to S or A** with a banner naming what replaced it. A document that is
   *wrong* is archived, never quietly deleted — things cite it. **The appending documents in particular** (R268,
   check 7): keep two CLOSED blocks in the sprint file; the third moves to the archive at the close. HANDOFF §2 keeps
   one "now" bullet and STATUS's Current state one dated bullet; the one they replace moves to the archive or the log.
6. **Stamp this file's "Last full review" line** with the date and the sprint, and name in the close-out commit what
   the review changed. A review that changed nothing says so explicitly; that is a result too.
7. **The known-issue stack, in full** -- §7 below. Its result goes into the same close-out commit, in the same
   sentence as this review's.

**When a document is found wrong, record the wrongness, not just the fix.** The audit table in `ROADMAP.md` §0 is the
pattern: what was claimed, what is actually true, how long it had been wrong. That is the only way the next review
knows which documents to distrust.

## 6. Rules for writing, so there is less to maintain

- **A fact has one home.** Before writing a number, ask which document owns it and link there instead. Four documents
  held the suite count; one was right.
- **Prefer a pointer to a copy**, and prefer a generated file to either. `KNOBS.md` and `LADDER.md` have never been
  wrong, because nobody writes them.
- **A document that tells agents what to do is code.** It gets audited like code. The `loop-iteration` skill is opened first by
  every iteration, so it carries no state; `HANDOFF.md` must carry state, so its one dangerous number is now tested.
- **Date anything that is a moment.** A filename date costs nothing and makes the class obvious at a glance.
- **Supersede in place, never rewrite history.** Blockquote the old claim, say what replaced it, keep the text. The
  archived roadmap is readable *because* its wrong turns are still in it.
- **If a claim cannot be checked, do not make it.** "The game runs well" ages badly; "43-45 fps in a mission,
  measured on <date>, against the console's 60" does not — it simply becomes a dated fact.

## 7. The known-issue stack review — deep, at every sprint close

`docs/GIT_STRATEGY.md` §7 puts every technically well-defined, unresolved defect on GitHub issues, one each, cited
from its `docs/KNOWN.md` row as `issue #N`. Between closes the loop keeps the pair true per task (the `loop-iteration` skill's
step 6). At the close the whole stack is read, because an issue tracker rots exactly the way a document does: a
fixed thing left open, an open thing nobody owns, a bar that no longer says what would close it, a milestone that
became a wish list. This runs beside §5, under the same rule (a sprint without it is not closed), and its result is
written into the same close-out commit. Budget: about an hour for a stack under fifty, which holds only because
step 3's §4 half is limited to the `HAZARD` / `Open:` headlines (the first run of the unlimited scan listed 75 of
§4's 84 bullets, nearly all lessons). A fresh read-only agent can do steps 2-4 and hand back a table; the controller
acts on it.

1. **`python -m tools_py.issues audit --stale-since <the day the sprint opened>`** — exit 0 before anything else. A
   problem is fixed on the side that is wrong: the row, the citation, the label, or the issue. Never the check.
2. **Every open issue, read against the tree.** Four questions each, answered in a comment only when the answer
   changes something. *Is it still true?* — a commit may have met the bar without saying `Closes`: close it with the
   artefact. *Is the bar still the right bar?* — the experiment may have been superseded: rewrite the Closing bar
   section and say why. *Is the evidence still where the body says?* — an archived log moved to `D:`: say where.
   *Is the area right?*
3. **Every KNOWN §2 row and every live hazard in `docs/HAZARDS.md` (by area), the other way round.** Each either
   cites an open issue, cites a closed one and reads as settled, or is ruled not to qualify — and the audit's "rows
   neither cited, settled nor ruled out" list is exactly the set to rule on. A row ruled out says why in a few words
   at its end (*no issue: the owner's ears*; *no issue: a lesson, nothing left to fix*), so the next review does not
   re-ask. In `docs/HAZARDS.md` the audit lists only a bullet whose headline says `HAZARD` or `Open:` — the two forms
   KNOWN already uses for a hazard that is still live — because most of the hazards are lessons, which
   `docs/GIT_STRATEGY.md` §7.1 keeps out of the stack; a hazard that is a live defect is written in one of those two
   forms, or the audit will not ask about it.
4. **Every issue closed this sprint** (`gh issue list --state closed --label known-issue --search "closed:>=<open
   date>"`): its closing comment names an artefact, and the KNOWN row says the same thing. A close with no artefact is
   reopened -- **unless the owner closed it.** An owner's close stands (`docs/HANDOFF.md` rule 13: the loop does not
   undo the owner), and the row records their words in place of an artefact, struck and led with the verdict, as
   `docs/KNOWN.md`'s dropped rows are. The audit notes every completed close whose last comment is not the tool's
   "Closing bar met" line, so the reviewer sees the case instead of acting on it blind.
5. **The carry.** What is still open in the closing sprint's milestone either moves to the next sprint's milestone
   (because the next plan names it) or to no milestone (the backlog) — with the `carried` label and one comment
   saying why it did not close. Then the milestone is closed and the next sprint's is created. **An issue carried
   twice is a question for the owner** (`docs/HUMAN_TASKS.md`): keep it, or close it as not planned under a ruling.
   Two commands do it: `python -m tools_py.issues carry N --comment "..." [--milestone "Sprint N+1"]` for each
   issue (label, comment and milestone at once; it refuses an issue already carried twice), then
   `python -m tools_py.issues milestone close "Sprint N" --next "Sprint N+1"` (it refuses while an open issue is
   left in it). A third records it: `python -m tools_py.issues backlog` regenerates `docs/BACKLOG.md` (R267), the carry's one home, and the close-out commit carries it; an
   item ruled not to be an issue goes into `docs/backlog_ruled_out.txt` with its ruling and bar.
6. **Duplicates and contributor handles.** Merge duplicates (close as not planned, "duplicate of #M"; the survivor
   gets the evidence). Put `help wanted` on what a stranger without a disc could take, `good first issue` only where
   the bar is a test they can run themselves.
7. **The record.** The close-out commit and `docs/STATUS.md`'s entry say, dated: opened, closed and carried this
   sprint, the highest issue number, and what the review changed. A review that changed nothing says so. The
   first half is `python -m tools_py.issues tally --since <the day the sprint opened>`, one sentence to paste.

# Sprint 18 Implementation Plan — "the PCSX2 door" (OPEN 2026-10-01 02:40Z on `sprint-18` off `sprint-17` at the opening commit; proposed 02:10Z; GitHub milestone 8)

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: the project's `loop-iteration` skill runs this plan (one task at a time,
> a failing test first, a fresh reviewer per task, the lock for every build and run, every lock-bound step a window);
> it is the project's form of superpowers:subagent-driven-development. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax.

> Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-sprint-18-the-pcsx2-door-design.md` (the owner's word of 2026-10-01
> ~02:00Z, quoted in its head). Written by the main-tree controller session against `sprint-17` at `caa149d9`. Task
> bodies (files, steps, tests, verification) are in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-01-sprint-18-tasks.md`

**Goal:** the launcher has a global NATIVE / PCSX2 client toggle with entirely separate saved settings; in the PCSX2
client a player selects or installs PCSX2 (one INSTALL button, the official GitHub release, verified), picks our
server or a custom address (the community server stays "coming soon"), and LAUNCH starts PCSX2 on their ISO with the
network pointed at the server's name service and the DNAS bypass in place; the hosted box answers SOCOM II's host
names on 53/udp; one proof from this host reaches our lobby through PCSX2.

**Architecture:** a pure core in `ps2xShared` (`client_mode`, `pcsx2_config`, `pcsx2_files`, `pcsx2_install`: JSON,
the ini merge, the pnach, the release parse, the DNS pick — all testable without raylib or a socket), four glue
additions (`startProcess`, a redirect-following download, `runAndWait`, `resolveIpv4` + the adapter list), and a UI
that reuses the pages: a rail per mode, one new page (PCSX2), the PLAY / DISC / ONLINE pages reading the active mode's
config and filtering the rows that do not apply. On the box, a Python DNS answerer as a fifth systemd unit, installed
by the same `install.sh`. Spike first, box second, proof last.

**Tech Stack:** C++17 (llvm-mingw, `build.sh runtime`), `ps2xTest` (MiniTest), Python 3 unittest, raylib UI,
WinHTTP, `C:\Windows\System32\tar.exe` (bsdtar), systemd, `aws lightsail`, `vm/lightsail/ssh.sh`, PCSX2 v2.8.x.

## Global Constraints

- **Order:** T0 (spike, a window) and T1 (box, lock-free) first and in parallel; T2 → T3 → T4 pure, lock-free, each in
  its own agent worktree on `agent/s18-*`; T5 → T6 UI (a launcher build under the lock each); T7 the proof (a window the
  owner names, O20); T8 the documents. A task out of order needs a ruling.
- **Rulings R339–R344** (the spec §2.2's R-A…R-F, numbered at the open) bind every task.
- **Nothing of the native client changes behaviour:** `config.json`'s keys, `Config`, `environmentFor`, the nine native
  pages' layout tests all pass unchanged except where a test names the rail or `kPageCount` (T5 updates those).
- **No file of a player's own PCSX2 is rewritten whole** (R-F): the ini is merged key by key inside `[DEV9/Eth]`; the
  pnach is written only when its bytes differ, the old one kept once as `.bak-<stamp>`.
- **No PCSX2 bytes in our repository or archives** (R-C): the launcher downloads; tests use a loopback server and a
  tiny stand-in archive built by the test.
- **The box:** `open-instance-public-ports` only (adds); `muis.json` untouched; the unit runs as `horizon`, binds the
  private interface, answers the six names only; verified from off the box before T1 closes.
- **Windows (R297):** every launcher build announced as a window; every PCSX2 boot in a window the owner names; nothing
  heavy under 3 GB free; the lock for both.
- **Commits:** `type(scope): what and why` ≤ 120 chars, `-- <paths>` on every commit, the session trailer.
- **Documents:** the `doc-maintenance` skill before writing into KNOWN, HAZARDS, LATER, DEVELOPING, HUMAN_TASKS.

## Review Focus

Inputs the spec implies that a task's own tests must pin (each line names its owning task; the test is written there):

1. **A `config.pcsx2.json` from a newer or older build** — unknown keys ignored, a missing key keeps its default, a
   malformed file is the defaults with one stderr line, never a crash or a half-read struct (T2).
2. **A player's PCSX2.ini with `[DEV9/Eth]` already present and other sections after it** — the merge replaces only
   our keys in that section, keeps every other line byte for byte, and appends the section when absent (T3).
3. **A server preset whose name does not resolve, or a Custom field holding a name, an IP with spaces, or nothing** —
   LAUNCH is refused with the sentence naming the name, never a PCSX2 started with `DNS1 =` empty (T3, T6).
4. **A release JSON with no Windows 7z asset, a digest in another algorithm, or a redirect to a host that is not
   `*.githubusercontent.com`** — INSTALL stops with a sentence, downloads nothing or deletes the partial file (T4).
5. **Switching the client while the native config is dirty, or while a game runs** — the dirty file is saved first,
   the other file is never written, and the running process keeps its own mode's LAST RUN line (T5, T6).

## The task table

| # | Task | Kind | Where | Verification | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T0 | The spike: five PCSX2 questions on a fresh v2.8.2 (spec §3) | lock-bound (one PCSX2 boot, a window) | main tree, scratch folder under `logs/s18_spike/` | `docs/research/83-pcsx2-door-spike.md` answers 1-5 with the emulog lines | open | <!-- docmaint: future -->
| T1 | The box's name service: `socom-dns.py`, its unit, `install.sh`/`horizon-ctl.sh`, 53/udp | lock-free; the owner's authority for the firewall (spec head) | `agent/s18-dns`; the box by `vm/lightsail/ssh.sh` | `python -m unittest tools_py.tests.test_socom_dns`; `nslookup socom2-prod.pdonline.scea.com 3.143.65.100` from this host answers 3.143.65.100 | DEPLOYED 2026-10-02 08:27Z (b08937c0; on-box answers verified); the 53/udp rule is O33, the off-box `nslookup` follows it |
| T2 | The mode and the second config: `client_mode`, `pcsx2_config`, JSON, `kPresetComingSoonNote` | lock-free, pure | `agent/s18-config` | `ps2x_tests --filter pcsx2_config` and `client_mode` green; the launcher suite unchanged | DONE (code) fcefe7b2 on `sprint-18` 2026-10-02; the ONLINE r0004 reason goes to T6 |
| T3 | What the launcher writes for PCSX2: the ini merge, the pnach (embedded from the masters), the root, the DNS pick | lock-free, pure | `agent/s18-files` | `ps2x_tests --filter pcsx2_files`; `tools_py/tests/test_pcsx2_masters.py` extended to the embedded copy | DONE (code) e1a23903 on `sprint-18` 2026-10-02 |
| T4 | INSTALL: the release parse, the redirect-following download, `runAndWait`, `resolveIpv4`, adapters | lock-free; glue + pure | `agent/s18-install` | `ps2x_tests --filter pcsx2_install` with the loopback server; `--install-pcsx2 <dir>` headless on this host (one real download, 26 MB) | DONE (code) bb7e9612 on `sprint-18` 2026-10-03; the real download rides on T7; the lock file and start-up recovery to T5/T6 |
| T5 | The UI, part one: the top-bar toggle, the rail per mode, `Page::Pcsx2` (layout, page, tips) | a launcher build (lock) | `agent/s18-ui1` | the focus tests for both rails; `--screenshot` walk adds `pcsx2` shots; the pcsx2 tips test | open |
| T6 | The UI, part two: PLAY / DISC / ONLINE in the PCSX2 view, the launch block, LAST RUN | a launcher build (lock) | `agent/s18-ui2` | `--selftest` prints both configs; the PCSX2 PLAY blocked-reasons test; a launch from the window starts PCSX2 (T7 proves the rest) | open |
| T7 | The proof: INSTALL → BIOS → LAUNCH → wizard → our lobby, from this host, against the public box | lock-bound, a window (O20) | main tree | `logs/s18_proof/` (the emulog, the launcher log, the lobby shot); a KNOWN row | open |
| T8 | The documents: DEVELOPING (launcher files, the box's DNS), `server/README.md`, `docs/PCSX2_PLAY.md`, LATER rows, HUMAN_TASKS rows, CURRENT_SPRINT | lock-free | main tree | `python -m unittest tools_py.tests.test_doc_maintenance`; the ceilings | open | <!-- docmaint: future -->

GitHub issues, milestone 8: T0 #121, T1 #122, T2 #123, T3 #124, T4 #125, T5 #126, T6 #127, T7 #128, T8 #129.

Owner's rows this sprint adds to `docs/HUMAN_TASKS.md` (T1 and T8 write them): **O28** the firewall rule if the AWS
session is not live when T1 runs; **O29** the two-home hosted round (two players, two routers, one hosts) and the
first run with the player group; **O30** the guide's copy on the site (`From your disc to the lobby`, a PCSX2
subsection) once the scotho design system lands.

## Rulings (numbered at the open from HANDOFF §2's counter; the full text and the reasons are the spec §2.2)

- **R339 (2026-10-01 02:40Z, Sprint 18 open, the spec's R-A) — two clients, one toggle, two files: a global NATIVE / PCSX2 client mode in the top bar, saved in `launcher.json`; the native client keeps `config.json` unchanged; the PCSX2 client has `config.pcsx2.json` and its own struct; no key shared, no value copied, switching never writes the other file.** Owner: "the global settings/saved settings for the two should be entirely unique."
- **R340 (2026-10-01 02:40Z, Sprint 18 open, R-B) — the community server stays "coming soon" in both views: the `community` preset keeps its placeholder address, its row is drawn greyed with the note `kPresetComingSoonNote` = "coming soon"; our server and Custom are live in both.** Owner: "Continue to block the community server as coming soon but prepare everything required to connect to our server or an arbitrary dns."
- **R341 (2026-10-01 02:40Z, Sprint 18 open, R-C) — PCSX2 comes from its official GitHub release, verified by the API's sha256 and size, downloaded over https following redirects only from `github.com` to a `*.githubusercontent.com` host, extracted by the system's `tar.exe`; nothing of PCSX2 ships in our repository or archives; SELECT names a player's own `pcsx2-qt.exe` instead.** Owner: "a single install button that obtains it from their official repo."
- **R342 (2026-10-01 02:40Z, Sprint 18 open, R-D) — the hosted box answers SOCOM II's six retail host names on 53/udp with `muis.json`'s `Endpoint`, NXDOMAIN for every other name, rate-capped per source, as a fifth systemd unit installed by `server/linux/install.sh`; the firewall gains 53/udp by `open-instance-public-ports` (adds), never `put-`.** Owner: "I grant you authority to make the dns changes on the lightsail machine if you have access in the sprint; if not the agent doing it can request them from me." An expired AWS session is the owner's row (O28), never a login by the loop.
- **R343 (2026-10-01 02:40Z, Sprint 18 open, R-E) — the PCSX2 client plays r0001 this sprint: its GAME VERSION row draws r0004 greyed with `kPcsx2RevisionNote`; r0004 on PCSX2 (the card package writer) is a `docs/LATER.md` row.** Why: everyone on the plain disc is one revision, so everyone can join everyone (KNOWN: the two revisions cannot join each other's games).
- **R344 (2026-10-01 02:40Z, Sprint 18 open, R-F) — PCSX2 owns what PCSX2 owns: the launcher writes `[DEV9/Eth]` (merged key by key) and `patches/0F6FC6CF.pnach` (the guarded master, replaced only when different, the old copy kept once as `.bak-<stamp>`) and nothing else in a PCSX2 the player selected; in the one it installed it may also lay out the folders; video, audio, controller, microphone and the BIOS are PCSX2's own pages, so the PCSX2 view has none of ours.** Owner: "everything else pcsx takes over"; "filter out what cannot be used."

## Outcome

(filled at the close: what landed, the proof's artefacts, the KNOWN rows moved, the LATER rows written, the owner's
rows left)

## Log (newest first)

- **2026-10-03 00:31Z** -- T4 DONE (code): `agent/s18-install` (66d74755; c37f1bca and bb7e9612 the two review rounds; the security review FAIL on the swap, then PASS WITH FINDINGS) merged into `sprint-18` by plumbing. `pcsx2_install.h/.cpp`: the release parsed with the shared JSON reader (the task book's text search would have stopped at the API's nested `uploader` object), the windows-x64-Qt.7z asset with its `sha256:` digest or a sentence (Review Focus 4), `redirectAllowed` (https github.com/api.github.com -> a `.githubusercontent.com` label-anchored host, one hop), `assetUrlAllowed` (https on exactly github.com; loopback only when the API is the loopback override), `extractArgv` (the system tar, no shell, UTF-8 paths), `pickAdapter`, `versionLine`; `win32glue`: `httpDownloadFollowing` (<= 3 hops, the policy on every 3xx, `.part` then rename), `runAndWait` (no shell, timeout -> kill), `resolveIpv4`, `listAdapters` (GetAdaptersAddresses), `startProcess` (CreateProcessW, the handle list or a failed start); the headless `--install-pcsx2 <dir>` and `--pcsx2-status <exe>`. INSTALL is atomic: everything into `pcsx2.new`, the marker after the exe is confirmed, then `pcsx2` -> `pcsx2.old` -> swap -> clean; a `.carry` manifest written before any player folder moves, recovery at the start of every INSTALL and in every rollBack moving the listed folders back before anything is deleted and refusing rather than deleting on a failed move; a fixed set of player folders (bios, memcards, inis, sstates, snaps, cheats, patches, covers, gamesettings, cache, textures, logs, videos) carried whole and merged with the player's file winning (R-C 'their updates intact', R-F the BIOS are the player's); the Dev knob `PS2X_LAUNCHER_PCSX2_TEST_FAIL` (carry | final-rename) for the fault-injection tests. Tests: `pcsx2_install` 10/10, `ps2x_tests` 1225 total 0 failed, the loopback `test_launcher_pcsx2_install` 17/17 (every case RED first on the previous launcher). Owed: the ONE real download from GitHub (Step 7; this seat connects to no outside host on its own -- it rides on T7's proof window); `startGame` -> `startProcess` (unprovable without a game run); `posix_glue.cpp`'s first compile is Linux CI. FOR T5/T6 (named here): a lock file in `<dir>` so two INSTALLs cannot run at once; run the `.carry` recovery at launcher start, not only after a successful release query (offline, an interrupted install stays in `pcsx2.old`); `GameProcess::logPath` is UTF-8 from `startProcess` but ANSI from `startGame`; a rollBack after a merge leaves the release's extra files in the player's folder (nothing lost).

- **2026-10-02 23:15Z** -- T3 DONE (code): `agent/s18-files` (61d7c91c; e1a23903 the review's fixes; review PASS WITH FINDINGS) merged into `sprint-18` by plumbing. `pcsx2_files.h/.cpp`: `kPnachMaster` embedded from `scripts/parity/pcsx2/0F6FC6CF.pnach` at configure time (the LF form on every host; `CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`; the generated header private to one translation unit), `dataRoot`, `dev9Keys` = the harness's `PCSX2.ini.dev9-section` keys and values (EthLogDHCP/EthLogDNS/PS2IP/Mask/Gateway left to the player as Step 4 says), `mergeIniSection` keeping every other byte and CRLF, matching sections and keys case-insensitively with the name trimmed in its brackets (the review's finding: a hand-edited `[dev9/eth]` would otherwise get a second section and PCSX2 might keep the player's `false`), `isDottedIpv4`, `dnsServerFor` with the exact error text, `writeIfDifferent` with the once-kept `.bak-<stamp>`; nine `pcsx2_files` cases (`PS2X_TEST_SUITE=pcsx2_files`) and three Python cases in `test_pcsx2_masters.py` pinning the embed to the tracked master; `ps2x_tests` 1215 total, 0 failed. The first worktree build died at the host's memory floor (0xC0000142 on 18 runtime objects, 4 GB free with four sessions); the retry with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=8` (so `build.sh` runs 8 jobs, not 28) passed -- a host-load lesson for the next worktree builds. Next: T4 (INSTALL: the release parse, the download, `runAndWait`, `resolveIpv4`, adapters), then T5/T6 (the UI; T6 takes the `alreadyOnPage` leftover), T0 and T7 in windows, T8 the documents.

- **2026-10-02 22:38Z** -- T2 DONE (code): `agent/s18-config` (fcefe7b2; review PASS WITH FINDINGS) merged into `sprint-18` by plumbing. `client_mode.h/.cpp` (ClientMode, `launcher.json`, exact-id parse), `pcsx2_config.h/.cpp` (the six keys and nothing of config.json's, R-A/R339; malformed = defaults; `pcsx2EffectiveServer` through the native rule), `kPresetComingSoonNote` on the ONLINE page's greyed preset row (R-B), `normalizeServerPreset` extracted from `fromJson` byte-identical; the six task-book cases in MiniTest form (`PS2X_TEST_SUITE=pcsx2_config`), registered in `ps2xTest/src/main.cpp`; the suite 1206 total, 0 failed on the implementer's run, one host-timing flake (`GsFrameBackpressure` R41) on the reviewer's loaded host, 29/29 on three reruns. Deviations from the task book: MiniTest has no TEST_CASE/CHECK; `ps2x_tests` selects suites by `PS2X_TEST_SUITE`, not `--filter`; a fresh worktree needs `./build.sh runtime --no-runner` before `test --no-runner`. FOR T6 (named here so it is not missed): `ps2xLauncher/src/ui/pages.h:251-256` `alreadyOnPage` still hides the greyed r0004 cell's reason on ONLINE because the preset row used to carry the same sentence; since T2 it says 'coming soon', so the cell shows no reason -- delete the `alreadyOnPage` check in T6's `gameVersionRow` rewrite (or a one-line fix). The leftover from T1 for T8: `server/README.md`'s hosting section landed (39b4abba); the 'four units' line fixed.

- **2026-10-02 08:28Z** — T1 DEPLOYED on the box, the firewall rule owed (O33). The first deploy (08:10Z) crashed on start: `KeyError: 0` -- the box's `muis.json` holds `Universes` as a dict of app-id lists (`"10472"`, `"0"`; the server's `Dictionary<int, UniverseInfo[]>`), not the list the task book assumed; the unit was disabled to stop the 5-second restart loop. `agent/s18-dns-muis` (0028026f the dict/list/single-object reader, enabled-only, one shared endpoint or exit; 8c0b0bee malformed or non-object JSON exits with a message; reviews PASS WITH FINDINGS, the leftovers below) merged at b08937c0 and redeployed: `socom-dns` active, `socom-dns listening on <the box's private address>:53, answering 3.143.65.100 for 6 names, 20/s per source`; on the box `nslookup -type=A socom2-prod.pdonline.scea.com` -> `3.143.65.100`, `example.com` -> NXDOMAIN; `ss` shows the private address on :53 beside resolved's two loopback listeners; `horizon-ctl.sh status` lists `socom-dns active` and the `udp 53 DNS ... LISTENING` row. Off the box the lookup times out until the owner opens 53/udp (`docs/HUMAN_TASKS.md` O33: the AWS session is expired); Step 7 from this host follows. Leftovers for T8/LATER: a missing or non-UTF-8 `--muis` file still tracebacks (older than T1's fixes), a BOM-prefixed file is refused where Horizon's loader likely accepts it, `server/README.md`'s hosting section and its 'four units' line.

- **2026-10-02 08:10Z** — T1 DONE (code): `agent/s18-dns` (9f40f751 the service, the unit, the wrapper, the install and control-script edits, 13 tests; 6e68c7bf the review's findings: the rate cap prunes once a second, the wrapper binds the first dotted quad, `server/ops/health.sh` counts five units; reviews PASS WITH FINDINGS then PASS) merged into `sprint-18` by the main-tree controller (socom-pc-0f) as a plumbing merge commit, no checkout -- the main tree stays on `sprint-17` for its chain. Owed: the deploy to the box, the 53/udp firewall rule (the owner's authority), `nslookup` from this host (Steps 6-7), `server/README.md`'s hosting section and its 'four units' line; the changelog regenerates when the branches converge. Started beside Sprint 17's wind-down as lock-free work (the owner's word of 02:45Z: Sprint 18 follows it).

- **2026-10-01 02:40Z** — OPEN. The owner approved the write-up ("excellent. write this up as a formal sprint 18"):
  the spec to APPROVED, rulings R339–R344 numbered (HANDOFF §2's counter bumped past them, `docs/RULINGS.md` regenerated),
  GitHub milestone 8 with one issue per task, `sprint-18` cut off `sprint-17` at the opening commit, CURRENT_SPRINT's
  header carries the second open branch. First items: T0 (a window) and T1 (lock-free), in parallel.
- **2026-10-01 02:10Z** — spec and plan written in the main tree on `sprint-17` at `caa149d9` by the controller
  session, on the owner's word of this hour; the branch `sprint-18` is not cut yet; T0 and T1 are the first items.

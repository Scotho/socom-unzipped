# Current sprint

The loop's aim. The `loop-iteration` skill (`.claude/skills/loop-iteration/SKILL.md`) reads this file instead of carrying a sprint pointer of its own; the controller
updates it when a sprint opens or closes, and whenever the order changes. **If you are a new controller, read
`docs/HANDOFF.md` first** -- it says what is in flight and what is owed (the traps are `docs/HAZARDS.md`); this file says what to do next.

**The goal every sprint serves:** SOCOM II running natively on PC with online play, that a stranger runs by pointing the
launcher at their own r0001 ISO and playing a round against another stranger on a hosted Horizon server -- from a public
repository another person can fork, build and contribute to.

baselines:    the suite counts live in `docs/DEVELOPING.md` (the table under "Build, run, verify — a newcomer's first hour", rows 3–4) and nowhere else -- this
              line said C++ 686/686 and Python 1457 from 2026-09-20 to 2026-09-22, four sprints after they stopped
              being true, which is why `tools_py/tests/test_doc_maintenance.py` now refuses an undated count outside
              that file. `./build.sh test` exit 0 on the renamed tree (2026-09-25); last green chain: Sprint 17's batch-5 chain `s17_b5` on `1fd3cfdb` (2026-09-30 07:37Z-08:38Z: the Python suite 3939 `OK`, `ps2x_tests` 1159/1158/0, gate PINS MATCH 13, FRAME mean 16.72 worst1s 17.24, SYNCV 23.3/s -- C1's adoption gate; C2, the refusal count, N1 and #116-#118 behind it); before it Sprint 17's batch-4 chain `s17_b4d` on `881c5a18` (2026-09-29 10:03Z-10:55Z: gate 3/3 PINS MATCH, FRAME mean 16.90 worst1s 17.86, SYNCV 23.4/s; the quiet gates on that exe 16.67-16.92 ms, the VBlank cap); before it Sprint 16's batch-3 chain `s16_b3` on `aa030d1a` (2026-09-27 18:57Z-19:56Z: gate 3/3 PINS MATCH, HELDOUT 12/12,

"Lock-bound" means it needs a build or a launch: the loop lock, and a window -- announced by the session for a build,
named by the owner for a game run (the sitting's ruling of 2026-09-26, R297); "lock-free" can run at any time.

## Sprint 18 — OPEN 2026-10-01 02:40Z ("the PCSX2 door"; `sprint-18` off `sprint-17`, beside the open Sprint 17; milestone 8; R339-R344)

The owner's word of 2026-10-01 ~02:00Z: a global NATIVE / PCSX2 client toggle in the launcher with entirely separate
saved settings; in the PCSX2 client, SELECT your PCSX2 or INSTALL the official release (one button, a tooltip); our
server or a custom address, the community server still "coming soon"; the hosted box answers SOCOM II's host names on
53/udp (the owner granted the DNS changes on the Lightsail box; an agent without a live AWS session asks for the
firewall rule). Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-sprint-18-the-pcsx2-door-design.md`; plan
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-01-sprint-18-the-pcsx2-door.md` (the table, rulings R-A…R-F to be numbered, the Log);
task book `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-01-sprint-18-tasks.md` (T0 the spike and T1 the box first). Launcher-only
on our side: no runtime, recomp or parity change; its builds take the lock, its PCSX2 boots a window (O20).

## Sprint 16 — CLOSED 2026-09-28 (merged to `main` as `v0.16.0` at `d77b58c5`, PR #97, 02:53Z; the record of the sprint is the block below)

**Close-out (the PR body).** Opened 2026-09-27 07:00Z, closed 2026-09-28 01:24Z: one loop day, every merged branch reviewed by a
fresh agent. Landed -- **L**: #73 closed (the persona ledger written on a real login against our Horizon box: a per-descriptor RT
frame walk hands the plain MAS/MLS bodies to the recorder, the login driver's keyboard rows and focus walk fixed; PR #90) and #74
closed (the tooltips, PR #82). **R**: R1a's spike (RECOMPILE, R316, research/74), the download primitive (PR #88), the player and
developer release kinds (PR #85), #69 closed. **F**: F0's note (research/73: three quiet gates on one exe 28.99 / 26.93 / 27.09 ms,
median 27.09, spread 7.0 %; the GL replay thread is the wall -- the draw path's read-back inside `submit=` 568 ms/s, the harness's
screenshots 169, the uploads 81; F4 does not fire) and F2's one measured attempt (the `[gs-submit]` split; the RT fast path's guard
restored after Sprint 7's shrink: ADOPTED: the read-back 123 → 20 ms/s, `submit=` 568 → 541). **X**: `tools/` restored by one flag, #57's r0004 leg (PR #87), Dependabot #10.
**V0**: the Sprint 15 legs -- the chain green, #67's drag proof, T1b's capture (12/48 and nine dips, recorded as #91 and #42's).
Not done: R1b (the first-run helper: eight reviewed regeneration rounds to a byte-exact DNAS stage, stopped in the package stage --
research/76; #70 carried to Sprint 17 at `3d17f192` unmerged), R2/R3b/R4 (#71 carried), F1 (not run), F3 (fired, not started; #32
to the backlog), F5 (numbers only, no pin; #59 carried), X2, X4 (#41 to the backlog). The owner's play test (22:40Z): the drag no
longer freezes, the audio much better, the online screens' music the one lingering defect (#94, Sprint 17), the personas working
superficially. The close proof: the batch-4 chain's suites green in rerun 4 (`ea24b339`) and the gate and the fourth leg by hand on its exe `2430919f…` (`s16_b4g`, 01:16Z): 3/3 PASS, PINS MATCH (13), HELDOUT 12/12, `FRAME mean=28.82` -- the chain itself went red five times on causes outside the code, three of them the main tree's HEAD moving under other sessions' commits. Issues since the open: opened 4 (#91, #94, #95, #96), closed 5 (#67, #69, #73, #74, #75),
carried 6 (#32, #41, #57, #59, #70, #71); the highest is #96. The §5 review fixed 38 findings and archived Sprint 14's block; the §7
read found the audit clean, carried and re-titled, opened #95 and #96, closed the milestone, regenerated the backlog; R271's breaker
closed O2, O4, O5, O7, O8, O10 and O15 by default (R321). The Outcome in the plan has the bar row by row and the numbers.

**As it stood while open:**

Opened by the Sprint 16 controller off `main` at `d84ffbde` (above the Sprint 15 merge `10650369`, `v0.15.0`) on the
owner's word of 2026-09-27 (05:33Z the seat; 05:57Z cloud sessions on the credit and open tasks in the controller's
order; 06:16Z Sprint 15 closes without its play test and this controller runs it at the end). Four milestones with a bar
each -- **R** the exe-only release (#70's native first-run decrypt after a spike, #71's r0004 package, the player and
developer archives under R295, the first archives against a draft), **F** the frame rate (measured on a quiet host, the
GL thread's top phase, the -O2 A/B, the conditional levers, #59's ceiling as a refusal), **L** the launcher's face (#73
the persona viewer, #74 the tooltips), **X** fillers (tools/ restored by one flag, the beta matcher, #57's r0004 leg,
#41's menu frame, Dependabot #10). First: **V0**, the Sprint 15 legs the owner deferred, one chain at the end of this
controller's first block with the desk idle. The defaults D1-D15 are ruled R299-R313 in the plan (R315-R320 followed; R314 was never issued); the bar is the spec's
section 4; no regression (D6, R304). Before the open, on the owner's word: L2 as PR #82, L1a's design note, R3a
re-scoped, X1 reviewed, X5 merged (`d84ffbde`). The plan's Log is the live state; this block gains its table at the
close.

*Sprint 15's CLOSED block (v0.15.0 at `10650369`, PR #81) is in `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-closed-sprint-15.md` (moved 2026-10-01 at the Sprint 18 open, the ceiling rule).*

*Sprint 12's and Sprint 11's CLOSED blocks -- with Sprint 11's rulings ledger R245-R263 and the table of Sprint 12's `S12-Rn` rulings that touch Sprint 11 -- moved verbatim on 2026-09-26 (the Sprint 14 close, `docs/DOC_MAINTENANCE.md` §5 step 5) to `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-closed-sprints-11-12.md`.*

## The standing backlog and the Sprint 10 ledger (kept live at the 2026-09-25 split)

*The Sprint 9, 10 and 11 records that stood between here and the Sprint 11 close were moved verbatim on 2026-09-25
(Sprint 13 Task R1, R268) to `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-sprints-9-to-11.md`: "Sprint 11 — the record of the sprint" (the task-by-task record, the worktree table, the timestamped blocks such as 14:30Z, 16:00Z, 02:5xZ and 13:00Z), "The close, 2026-09-22 evening → 2026-09-23 morning", "Sprint 10 — CLOSED 2026-09-23", "The order, reworked 2026-09-20", "Sprint 9, milestone P", "Sprint 9, milestone Q", "Sprint 10, REORGANIZED 2026-09-20" (with its chunk table, its road table and "Rulings (R181-R183)"), "The playthrough, 2026-09-22" (the R236-R240 blocks), the Sprint 10 and Sprint 11 drafts, "Rulings made on the owner's behalf (no plan of their own)" (R174-R178) and "The Sprint 9 record". A citation of any of those block names means that
file. The two blocks below stay because the standing backlog is the filler list this file must keep
(`docs/DOC_MAINTENANCE.md`, the first review's lesson 1) and the ledger says it is the one home of R181-R244;
Sprint 11's ledger R245-R263 stayed above for the same reason until 2026-09-26, when it moved with Sprint 11's CLOSED
block to `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-closed-sprints-11-12.md` (the Sprint 14 close).*

#### Standing backlog, carried from the roadmap 2026-09-23 -- superseded 2026-09-25

**Superseded 2026-09-25 by R265 and R267** (`docs/audits/2026-09-25-project-audit.md` §4). The eight-item filler list
that stood here (moved from `docs/ROADMAP.md` §6 on 2026-09-23; its text is in this file's history before the Sprint 13
close) is no longer the queue: `docs/BACKLOG.md` is the carry's one home (R267), and the rows R265 declined are in
`docs/backlog_ruled_out.txt` with their bars. Where each item went: 1, the EE soft-double chain, **declined** by R265
(`soft-double-chain`); 2, HLE audit leg three, **owned** by Sprint 13 Task C2 (the plan's C2 row); 3, the gameplay-state
probe, **declined as a gate leg** by R265 (`gameplay-state-probe`), and 5, its `rx`-hold teleport count, goes with it;
4, the online freeze, is issue #34 (`docs/HAZARDS.md` network), its `waitReadable` shape bounded by V7 (`160ffdae`) with the
console-peer run as its bar; 6, the two believed render rows, carry R265's retire-or-test bar (`render-believed-rows`);
7, voice, and 8, multiplayer security, are `docs/BACKLOG.md` rows (the `voice-*` rows, `multiplayer-security`).

**Resolved 2026-09-25:** the citation R243 makes, `docs/research/40-upstream-divergence.md` (`83c02d98`), is in this
tree; the note that said it lived only on `agent/upstream` is withdrawn.

#### Sprint 10's rulings ledger, R181-R244 (reconciled at the close; this table is the one home)

Sixty-four numbers, sixty-three rulings: **R229 is deliberately vacant** -- it was declared free in words when Q4's
rulings were renumbered to R211-R217, and no decision was ever issued under it. Nothing here is renumbered. The
working notes behind this table are `.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-22-sprint-10-close/report-rulings.md`.

| R236 | "the launcher's **default window is the game's own 640x448**" | `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-sprints-9-to-11.md`, the R236 block | stands -- it **overturns R92**, Sprint 7's 2x default |
| R237 | "the prefilled login leaves the player path" | `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-sprints-9-to-11.md`, the R237 block | **Superseded by R310 (Sprint 16 L1, 2026-09-27)** for a persona whose card holds the password: V6 settled that the card keeps it (`docs/KNOWN.md` §3, the W10 row) and D12's persona record lets the launcher stop typing it; before that, **REWRITTEN 2026-09-23 by W10**: the persona survives a virgin-card restart, the saved password does not, so **the prefill stays** until the clean-exit launch settles which side loses the write |

**Below R181, kept verbatim from the index line this table replaced** (they are Sprint 9's and earlier, and no part
of this reconciliation): R179-R180 are Sprint 10 Goal 9's, recorded in its plan -- the password plain in
`config.json` (R179, superseded by R310 on 2026-09-27 for a persona whose card holds the password, Sprint 16 L1),
and prefill-never-submit; R178 is Q0's conductor grains (child sounds, registers, markers, from the
open reference), in `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-sprints-9-to-11.md`'s "Rulings made on the owner's behalf"; R177 is Q0's mix device buffer, 20 ms x 4, measured, the same block; R176 is P4's ADVANCED section --
what went in it and what did not; R175 is P6's -- the preset switch needs no launch and the server keeps advertising
its IP, the same block; R174 is Goal 12's split -- the mapping data path lands in Sprint 9 Q3, the UI is Sprint 10;
R152-R168 are reserved by the Goal 3 plan; R169-R171 are Goal 10's music fixes, COMMITTED in `eca5450`; R172 is Goal
10's declined proposal -- the concurrency cap, not taken, waiting on Q1's instrument; R173 is P3's, the pad display
staying live while the game runs.

**Three rulings changed state during the sprint and one changed state at the close:** R236 overturns R92 (Sprint 7);
R238 was corrected in place after its first telling was shown false; R239 was withdrawn by the very A/B it asked for;
and R237's premise was reversed by W10 on 2026-09-23. **Collisions: none. Missing: none.**

# Current sprint

The loop's aim. The `loop-iteration` skill (`.claude/skills/loop-iteration/SKILL.md`) reads this file instead of carrying a sprint pointer of its own; the controller
updates it when a sprint opens or closes, and whenever the order changes. **If you are a new controller, read
`docs/HANDOFF.md` first** -- it says what is in flight and what is owed (the traps are `docs/HAZARDS.md`); this file says what to do next.

**The goal every sprint serves:** SOCOM II running natively on PC with online play, that a stranger runs by pointing the
launcher at their own r0001 ISO and playing a round against another stranger on a hosted Horizon server -- from a public
repository another person can fork, build and contribute to.

branch:       sprint-14 -- CLOSED 2026-09-26 16:28Z (the PR to main and the tag v0.14.0 follow; opened 05:17Z off main at 6a82caaa (the Sprint 13 merge, PR #61, tagged v0.13.0;
              Sprint 12 merged as v0.12.0 at 74fe2a9b, PR #50; Sprint 11 as v0.11.0 at 173608af, PR #49). This
              machine's checkout is on sprint-14 (the Sprint 14 controller session); agents work in worktrees on
              agent/s14-* branches and the controller merges them. See "Sprint 14 -- CLOSED" below, then the Sprint 13
              CLOSED block (12's and 11's are archived, see plans). No cloud session runs from 2026-09-26.
spec:         docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-sprint-14-guards-not-sentences-design.md (seven milestones G, I, W, D,
              S, E, M with a bar each, the filler X1; the acceptance bar is its section 4; section 1.5 says what the
              loss of the cloud changed). The Sprint 13, 12 and 11 specs closed with v0.13.0, v0.12.0 and v0.11.0.
plans:        docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-26-sprint-14.md (the task table, the Log newest first, the rulings
              R269-R281 from the global counter -- no sprint-local names from this sprint on, R273); it came from
              docs/audits/2026-09-26-autonomy-structure-review.md (nine findings, options A-I, six notes beside it).
              The Sprint 13 plan (its rulings S13-R1..R14), the Sprint 12 plan (S12-R1..R25) and the Sprint 11 plan
              are closed; Sprint 13 is listed in its block below, Sprints 12 and 11 in
              docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-closed-sprints-11-12.md (moved 2026-09-26); Sprint 10's and older are in
              docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-sprints-9-to-11.md (the 2026-09-25 split, R268).
next sprint:  Sprint 15 "borrowed confidence" (R276): docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-sprint-15-borrowed-confidence-design.md
              and docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-26-sprint-15.md, PROPOSED, opened from the confidence register at
              this sprint's close; the standing "visible defects first" order resumes inside it. Its origin, the
              cloud handoff of 2026-09-25, never ran and is kept under a NEVER RUN banner
              (docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-25-borrowed-confidence-cloud-handoff.md).
human tasks:  docs/HUMAN_TASKS.md      playtest script: docs/PLAYTEST.md
git strategy: docs/GIT_STRATEGY.md     contributing: CONTRIBUTING.md
rulings:      indexed in docs/RULINGS.md (generated: every ruling with its status and home, Sprint 10's
              R181-R244 ledger table below included) and numbered from the one counter line, docs/HANDOFF.md
              section 2 (Sprint 14 D2).
baselines:    the suite counts live in `docs/DEVELOPING.md` (the table under "Build, run, verify — a newcomer's first hour", rows 3–4) and nowhere else -- this
              line said C++ 686/686 and Python 1457 from 2026-09-20 to 2026-09-22, four sprints after they stopped
              being true, which is why `tools_py/tests/test_doc_maintenance.py` now refuses an undated count outside
              that file. `./build.sh test` exit 0 on the renamed tree (2026-09-25); last gates (Sprint 13,
              2026-09-25): `s13_proof4_gate` 3/3 PINS MATCH (exe f90eeec0..., 22:16Z), `s13_v4_gate1` PASS on the
              same exe (23:51Z), `s13_proof3_gate` 3/3 (r0001, 20:54Z), `s13_names_r0004_gate` 3/3 PINS MATCH (r0004,
              d027546d...); the plan's Log has each; audio parity
              `s9_q1_parity_ours2` 31/48 (2026-09-20, unchanged since)
```

Markers used below: **[A]** autonomous; **[O]** the owner's hands, ears, money or decision; **[B: x]** blocked on x.
"Lock-bound" means it needs a build or a launch (the loop lock, `scripts/check_quiet_gate.sh` first -- the owner feels
long builds); "lock-free" can run at any time.

## Sprint 14 — CLOSED 2026-09-26 (the PR `sprint-14` -> `main` and the tag `v0.14.0` on its merge commit follow this close-out; the release waits on the owner's word; the record of the sprint is the block below)

**Close-out (the PR body).** Opened 2026-09-26 05:17Z, closed 2026-09-26 16:28Z: 231 commits, 46 merges (26 agent branches, five
of `main`, the close's three), every task reviewed by a fresh agent. No feature work (R269). Landed: the guards (a Bash and an
Edit/Write PreToolUse hook, the watcher reaper, `build.sh`'s lock check, the memory guard, the commit-msg hook); the read-first
set from 250 KB to 51 KB (`CLAUDE.md`, four skills, HANDOFF transient, HAZARDS split out, a budget check); four generated
pages (rulings, changelog, sitting, flow) each held to its source; the WIP cap (a third build waiter exits 4) and the merged
chain as the gate unit (two chains today: `s14_chain1` and `s14_close1`, both ALL GREEN, gate 3/3, the fourth leg 12/12);
gate freshness (exit 5), the recompiler reference job (red once on a planted change, run 36237829527), PRs to `main` built
on their heads (#61, #65, #66 observed). Rulings R269-R281. Issues since the open at 05:17Z: opened 1 (#67), closed 3
(#51, #53, #56), carried 0; the highest is #67. The DOC_MAINTENANCE §5 review fixed 31 stale claims across nineteen files
and archived two blocks; the §7 stack read found the audit clean, placed one evidence note, labelled four issues. The
owner's word at the close: the release waits; upstream filings wait (`docs/UPSTREAM.md`); candidate work now lives in
`docs/LATER.md`; Sprint 15 re-cut to value (audio first). The Outcome in the plan has the bar row by row.

**As it stood while open:**


Opened by the Sprint 14 controller off `main` at `6a82caaa` (the Sprint 13 merge, `v0.13.0`) on the owner's
instruction of 2026-09-26 ("begin with sprint 14 once sprint 13 is finished, committed, and live on main"). The
sprint came from the structure review `docs/audits/2026-09-26-autonomy-structure-review.md` (nine findings: the
record is the failure surface; rules recur, tools do not; greens that were not; an unbounded ruling log; one host,
many writers; handoffs lose state; the owner loop never closes; nothing measures cost; a thin verification
architecture). **No feature work.** Every rule that has recurred becomes something that fails on its own, every
document a session must read becomes small, generated or loaded on demand, and concurrency is capped until the host
stops corrupting measurements. The owner's word of 2026-09-26 sets aside "visible defects first" for this one sprint
(R269); the order resumes in Sprint 15.

Seven milestones in order, then a filler — **G** guards (a PreToolUse hook refusing the eight recurring git and lock
mistakes; an Edit/Write hook for running chain scripts; a session-end hook that reaps orphaned watchers; agent
definitions; `build.sh` consults the lock; a memory guard), **I** instructions on demand (a root `CLAUDE.md` under
sixty lines; four skills replace the prose procedures; HANDOFF transient under 6 KB; a read-first budget check;
KNOWN's hazards to their own file), **W** the host (the queue refuses a third building agent; the merged chain is the
gate unit, with eviction and ticket waits logged), **D** decisions with status (a generated rulings page; the scope
rule and one counter; a generated owner's sitting page; the circuit breaker; PLAYTEST's build block written by the
chain), **S** the record generated (the changelog; STATUS's log archived; a commit-msg hook; ceilings that ratchet
down; one home each), **E** evidence that is hard to fake (a PR to `main` built on its head; a held-out capture leg;
recompiler re-derivation in CI; gate freshness), **M** measurement (a generated flow page; token spend read locally,
never committed); **X1** the external sweep for Sprint 15, filler when the host is quiet. **Every guard is fired
against a planted violation before it counts as done.** The bar is the spec's section 4; the nine owner defaults and
their rulings R269-R277 are the plan's "Owner decisions" and "Rulings" sections. The plan's Log is the live state;
this block gains its table at the close.

## Sprint 13 — CLOSED 2026-09-26 (merged to `main` as `v0.13.0` at `6a82caaa`, PR #61, 2026-09-26 ~05:00Z after the owner granted the gh token the workflow scope; the record of the sprint is the block below)

**Close-out (the PR body).** Opened 2026-09-25 08:40Z, closed 2026-09-26 04:17Z: 285 commits, 43 agent merges, every task
reviewed by a fresh agent. Closed #27, #30, #31, #33, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #45, #46, #48; opened #45–#48, #51–#60;
carried #28, #32, #34, #59 once to the backlog and #25, #26, #42 to the owner (S13-R14, HUMAN_TASKS O16). The gate
`s13_merged_gate` 3/3 on the final exe `0633c484`; proofs 1–4 green on r0001 and r0004; CI green. Found unplanned: a
server-to-client memory write refused on the client (U6, SECURITY); the Sprint 11 chat bound is not on the game-lobby
path (O2, SECURITY 'partly fixed', #26 restated); a stub's table slot can hold an owner's resume entry (#60); the
loop lock's queue proven by a night hand-off and a first-time scheduled ladder. Not done on purpose: V5's audio steps
(the client muted), O1's console-peer leg (the owner's hands). Rulings S13-R1..R14. The DOC_MAINTENANCE §5 review
fixed 24 stale claims across nine documents and three KNOWN rows; the §7 stack read found the audit clean, relabelled
two issues, rewrote two bars, and placed three evidence notes. The Outcome in the plan has the bar row by row.

**As it stood while open:**

Opened by the local controller on the owner's instruction of the same night ("audit the entire structure of the
project, compile a master list, clean up docs as you go, and start your own sprint 13"). The audit is
`docs/audits/2026-09-25-project-audit.md` with six reports beside it; the spec is
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-sprint-13-nothing-carried-twice-design.md`. Eight milestones in the order the owner
meets them — **V** the player's first ten minutes (#30, #32, #31, a frame-time line, the music #42/#28, #27, #34, the
launcher's wording), **R** the record made true and small (the archive split and R268's ceilings, DEVELOPING as
current truth, the ruling record, HUMAN_TASKS reduced to the owner's sitting, KNOWN in full, one home for the carry),
**H** the harness pays its debts (the lock's queue #36/#35/#37, #45, #38, #46, #41, the per-revision literals, the fast
subset), **C** the code's hygiene and supply chain (CI compiles the overrides, the throwing stubs, the after-return
trap, FFmpeg with a hash, the dead configuration), **U** upstream and outside (research/63's picks, path containment,
#253's emitter change, a server-to-client record refused), **S** the stranger, **N** the naming follow-ups, **O**
online and the box. The bar: nothing leaves the sprint carried twice without a ruling; CI green with the overrides
compiled; the record under its ceilings; the first ten minutes measured; the gate 3/3 plus one ladder run and one
mixed leg on the sprint's final exe. The plan's Log is the live state; this block gains its table at the close.

**Owner decisions:** `docs/HUMAN_TASKS.md` carries them, O1–O15 (reduced by Task R4, `4adbf2bc`, `1ed975a4`), with
the plan's D1–D2; each has the default the loop is on.

*Sprint 12's and Sprint 11's CLOSED blocks -- with Sprint 11's rulings ledger R245-R263 and the table of Sprint 12's `S12-Rn` rulings that touch Sprint 11 -- moved verbatim on 2026-09-26 (the Sprint 14 close, `docs/DOC_MAINTENANCE.md` §5 step 5) to `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-closed-sprints-11-12.md`.*

## The standing backlog and the Sprint 10 ledger (kept live at the 2026-09-25 split)

*The Sprint 9, 10 and 11 records that stood between here and the Sprint 11 close were moved verbatim on 2026-09-25
(Sprint 13 Task R1, R268) to `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-sprints-9-to-11.md`: "Sprint 11 — the record of the sprint" (the task-by-task record, the worktree table, the timestamped blocks such as 14:30Z, 16:00Z, 02:5xZ and 13:00Z), "The close, 2026-09-22 evening → 2026-09-23 morning", "Sprint 10 — CLOSED 2026-09-23", "The order, reworked 2026-09-20", "Sprint 9, milestone P", "Sprint 9, milestone Q", "Sprint 10, REORGANIZED 2026-09-20" (with its chunk table, its road table and "Rulings (R181-R183)"), "The playthrough, 2026-09-22" (the R236-R240 blocks), the Sprint 10 and Sprint 11 drafts, "Rulings made on the owner's behalf (no plan of their own)" (R174-R178) and "The Sprint 9 record". A citation of any of those block names means that
file. The two blocks below stay because the standing backlog is the filler list this file must keep
(`docs/DOC_MAINTENANCE.md`, the first review's lesson 1) and the ledger says it is the one home of R181-R244;
Sprint 11's ledger R245-R263 stayed above for the same reason until 2026-09-26, when it moved with Sprint 11's CLOSED
block to `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-closed-sprints-11-12.md` (the Sprint 14 close).*

#### Standing backlog, carried from the roadmap 2026-09-23 -- superseded 2026-09-25

**Superseded 2026-09-25 by R265 and R267** (`docs/audits/2026-09-25-project-audit.md` §4). The eight-item filler list
that stood here (moved from `docs/ROADMAP.md` §6 on 2026-09-23; its text is in this file's history before the Sprint 13
close) is no longer the queue: `docs/BACKLOG.md` is the carry's one home (R267), and the rows R265 declined are in
`docs/backlog_ruled_out.txt` with their bars. Where each item went: 1, the EE soft-double chain, **declined** by R265
(`soft-double-chain`); 2, HLE audit leg three, **owned** by Sprint 13 Task C2 (the plan's C2 row); 3, the gameplay-state
probe, **declined as a gate leg** by R265 (`gameplay-state-probe`), and 5, its `rx`-hold teleport count, goes with it;
4, the online freeze, is issue #34 (`docs/HAZARDS.md` network), its `waitReadable` shape bounded by V7 (`160ffdae`) with the
console-peer run as its bar; 6, the two believed render rows, carry R265's retire-or-test bar (`render-believed-rows`);
7, voice, and 8, multiplayer security, are `docs/BACKLOG.md` rows (the `voice-*` rows, `multiplayer-security`).

**Resolved 2026-09-25:** the citation R243 makes, `docs/research/40-upstream-divergence.md` (`83c02d98`), is in this
tree; the note that said it lived only on `agent/upstream` is withdrawn.

#### Sprint 10's rulings ledger, R181-R244 (reconciled at the close; this table is the one home)

Sixty-four numbers, sixty-three rulings: **R229 is deliberately vacant** -- it was declared free in words when Q4's
rulings were renumbered to R211-R217, and no decision was ever issued under it. Nothing here is renumbered. The
working notes behind this table are `.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-22-sprint-10-close/report-rulings.md`.

**Below R181, kept verbatim from the index line this table replaced** (they are Sprint 9's and earlier, and no part
of this reconciliation): R179-R180 are Sprint 10 Goal 9's, recorded in its plan -- the password plain in
`config.json`, and prefill-never-submit; R178 is Q0's conductor grains (child sounds, registers, markers, from the
open reference), in `docs/archive/CURRENT_SPRINT-sprints-9-to-11.md`'s "Rulings made on the owner's behalf"; R177 is Q0's mix device buffer, 20 ms x 4, measured, the same block; R176 is P4's ADVANCED section --
what went in it and what did not; R175 is P6's -- the preset switch needs no launch and the server keeps advertising
its IP, the same block; R174 is Goal 12's split -- the mapping data path lands in Sprint 9 Q3, the UI is Sprint 10;
R152-R168 are reserved by the Goal 3 plan; R169-R171 are Goal 10's music fixes, COMMITTED in `eca5450`; R172 is Goal
10's declined proposal -- the concurrency cap, not taken, waiting on Q1's instrument; R173 is P3's, the pad display
staying live while the game runs.

**Three rulings changed state during the sprint and one changed state at the close:** R236 overturns R92 (Sprint 7);
R238 was corrected in place after its first telling was shown false; R239 was withdrawn by the very A/B it asked for;
and R237's premise was reversed by W10 on 2026-09-23. **Collisions: none. Missing: none.**

what was then `docs/HANDOFF.md` §5, the one home of the rules (since 2026-09-26 the rules are HANDOFF §4, one
line each, and their reasons `docs/archive/HANDOFF-to-2026-09-26.md` §5), and still said to push to `sprint-9` (the 2026-09-25 audit, D21).*

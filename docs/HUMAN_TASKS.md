# Human tasks — the owner's sitting

sittings: 2026-09-17, 2026-09-26 (read by tools_py.sitting)

What only the owner can decide or do, in one table. Every row stands on a default: the loop proceeds on it and never
waits. Rewritten 2026-09-25 (Sprint 13 Task R4) from the project audit's owner sitting
(`docs/audits/2026-09-25-project-audit.md` §3, rows O1–O13), with two rows that audit missed (O14, O15).

**The rule.** The loop adds a row only when it reaches a step it cannot verify or a decision that is not its to make;
it writes the default it proceeds on beside it and moves on. Anything the loop can do itself (a window on this machine,
a capture, a VM run, a draft, a document) is a sprint task or a backlog row, never a row here.

**Numbers.** `O<n>` is a row of this table. A Sprint 13 task in milestone O is written "S13 O1". The old decision
numbers are named by their sprint — "Sprint 11 D2", "naming D1–D7" (Sprint 12), "r0004 D1" — because the list this
replaced used bare D-numbers for three different tables (documents audit D61).

**Before 2026-09-25.** The list this replaced — its "Start here" blocks, the "Sprint 11 close" and "Sprint 12 close"
sections, the numbered items and the `## Open` checkboxes — is `docs/archive/HUMAN_TASKS-to-2026-09-25.md`, verbatim,
under a table that gives each of its 87 items a disposition. Any citation of this file's sections, items or line
numbers written before that day means the archive.

| O | the decision or the hand | the default the loop is on | settles | first asked |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| O1 | ~~**The legal position on shipping `socom2.exe` and the decrypted `socom2_game.elf`**~~ **Answered 2026-09-26 (R290): the exe ships in release archives only, never in the repository; the ELF never ships; the native first-run decrypt from the player's disc is #70. The full row is in the archive.** | ~~no public download; builds reach testers only by your hand~~ | audit F3; carry C5 | 2026-09-20 |
| O2 | **The release drafts** (`v0.10.0` to `v0.14.0`, all empty): delete the older drafts or keep them; a private off-machine home for each release's `dist-release/symbols/`; a dry run of the release-draft workflow's verify half on a scratch draft (yes/no); the publish click once the exe-only archive exists (#70, R290). | the drafts stay empty; the loop builds the archives short of the upload; publishing is always your click | carry C2, C3 | 2026-09-20 |
| O3 | ~~**What the public tree holds and under which terms**~~ **Answered 2026-09-26 (R291): the audio fixtures regenerated from the disc and dropped from HEAD, the rest stays, no rewrite, GPL-3.0 for everything of ours, unsigned until a release. The full row is in the archive.** | ~~nothing moves; GPL-3.0 for the whole tree; unsigned; the deploy is yours~~ | carry C6–C10; stranger S48 | 2026-09-20 |
| O4 | **The message to the PSRewired moderator** (the archive, "Send this to the PSRewired moderator"), with O5's Goal F question in the same message. The rest of this row was answered 2026-09-26 (R292): I1 and I2 built, the site's five items in its TODO. | unsent; you send it in the coming days | carry C15, C16 | 2026-09-20 |
| O5 | **PSRewired, what only you can ask** (Goal F): their word on a PC-native client fetching the r0004 package and playing; whether their players carry `mc0:UPDATE.DAT`; the community preset's address, when you say so. The rest was answered 2026-09-26 (R293): the launcher fetches the package itself (#71), two rooms when needed (#72), no r0004 disc, HDD maps far future, connections to their server by your hand only. | the preset stays `COMMUNITY_SERVER_ADDRESS_TBC`; the loop never connects on its own | carry C17, C21–C24, C26 | 2026-09-17 |
| O6 | ~~**The machine's windows and a second machine**~~ **Answered 2026-09-26 (R294): no nightly ladder, the entry stays disabled and the online tests run when a task needs them; the second machine not yet. The full row is in the archive.** | ~~the scheduled entry stays DISABLED~~ | carry C87, C89 | 2026-09-17 |
| O7 | **Your ears and hands on the current build**, on a quiet machine: one listen to the music against the console (mission, briefing, options); Q4's four tries on a real pad; the CONTROLLER page's hold-to-remap; the prefilled login with your real persona. The profile viewer is wanted and is #73 (R295). | the loop does not wait (the listen gate bypassed since 2026-09-20) | carry C60, C119–C122 | 2026-09-17 |
| O8 | **A PLAYTEST sitting on the current build** (`docs/PLAYTEST.md`), on a quiet machine. The decision in it was answered 2026-09-26 (R295): the player archive drops the debugger and the probes, a developer archive keeps them. | the loop rewrites PLAYTEST for each build it can hand over; the report's log box stays OFF | carry C126; audit F10 | 2026-09-20 |
| O10 | **Public actions upstream**: file the two PS2Recomp issues with their patches, the ten KEEP comments and the two BinExport issues from `docs/research/assets/63-upstream-drafts/` (its README orders them). | file later (owner, 2026-09-26): nothing filed; `docs/UPSTREAM.md` is the register | audit E5; external X9, X10, X20 | 2026-09-25 |
| O11 | ~~**The naming programme's owner rows**~~ **Answered 2026-09-26 (R296): the defaults stand; the hand read, the 148 and the matcher over the Aug 28 2003 beta (in hand, `game/beta_scus_973_66/`) are one future task. The full row is in the archive.** | ~~the defaults stand; no hand names; the 148 stay applied; nothing is looked for~~ | carry C32, C33, C48, C50, C51; audit E8, H5, H6 | 2026-09-25 |
| O12 | ~~**The crouch default**~~ **Answered 2026-09-26 (R296): `l3` in the knob too (the #69 worktree's fourth commit); tooltips on the CONTROLLER page are #74. The full row is in the archive.** | ~~the launcher's `l3`~~ | audit A10 (F54) | 2026-09-25 |
| O13 | ~~**Repository settings and history**~~ **Answered 2026-09-26 (R294): approvals stay 0 and reviewed agent code merges to `main` until stability; Dependabot #8 and #9 merged; homepage and topics set; SECURITY says reports are read; history untouched. The full row is in the archive.** | ~~as they are; no history rewrite~~ | carry C11–C14, C20; stranger S39–S41, S46 | 2026-09-20 |
| O14 | ~~**The merged-branch sweep**~~ **Done 2026-09-26 (R296): the `sprint-*` ruleset lifted, 16 merged remote branches deleted (`fix/gl-depth-precision`, `fix/gs-block-pointer`, `sprint-1` to `sprint-14`), the ruleset restored. The full row is in the archive.** | ~~the branches and the ruleset stay~~ | carry C4 | 2026-09-20 |
| O15 | **Linux on real hardware** (a Linux PC or a Steam Deck): the tarball's launcher opens, the game boots with music and the pad, the first three `[gs-gl]` lines of the run log, and R107's title-loop correlation. | not yet (owner, 2026-09-26: no such machine at hand); CI and the VM stand in; the VM half is the loop's backlog | carry C123 | 2026-09-18 |
| O16 | ~~**Three issues carried twice**~~ **Answered 2026-09-26 (R296): #25, #26 and #42 stay on the backlog; the next plan that names one takes it. The full row is in the archive.** | ~~keep all three on the backlog~~ | S13-R14 | 2026-09-26 |
| O18 | ~~**The private-inputs location**~~ **Answered 2026-09-26 (R296): retired -- the loop's half is #75, the site's half in its TODO. The full row is in the archive.** | ~~nothing changes; the fetch script stays~~ | Sprint 14 D9 | 2026-09-26 |
| O19 | ~~**`tools_py/story/site.py`, modified and uncommitted in the main tree**~~ **Answered 2026-09-26 (R296): committed as the owner's, `83c62d75`. The full row is in the archive.** | ~~stashed around each night chain and restored (R281)~~ | Sprint 14 W2 | 2026-09-26 |
| O20 | **Windows for game runs** (R297): the hours a controller may run a game on this machine. First asked for the Sprint 15 drag test in a mission (#67, code-complete, its run waiting). | no game run by a controller until you name a window; builds are announced as windows | R297 | 2026-09-26 |

O9 and O17, answered, are in the archive (`docs/archive/HUMAN_TASKS-to-2026-09-25.md`, struck rows); reopenable by number.

**How to answer.** One line per decision — "O5: acceptable for v1", "O12: off" — in the next session's prompt or as a
line in the open plan's Log. The loop strikes the row with the date and the ruling that records the answer, and moves
the work it opens into a task.

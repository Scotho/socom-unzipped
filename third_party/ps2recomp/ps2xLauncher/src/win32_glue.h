    //   The guide button. raylib (5.5, the GLFW desktop platform) maps GLFW_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_GUIDE to
    //   GAMEPAD_BUTTON_MIDDLE, so it arrives like any button -- WHEN the backend delivers it. Linux does: GLFW
    //   reads evdev and every Xbox/DualShock row of its mapping table carries `guide:b<n>` (BTN_MODE). Windows
    //   does for a DirectInput pad with a mapping row (the PS4/PS5 rows carry `guide:b12`), and does NOT for an
    //   XInput pad: GLFW polls XInputGetState, whose wButtons never carries the guide bit, and its XInput row has
    //   no `guide:` at all. xinput1_4.dll's ordinal 100 (the undocumented XInputGetStateEx, which SDL and every
    //   emulator use) does report it as 0x0400, so the launcher asks that directly, for every XInput user, and
    //   ORs it into the pad's guide. `xinputGuideReadable` says whether the entry point was found (the CONTROLLER
    //   page's status says so when it was not); POSIX answers false to both and leaves the guide to raylib.

    //   input queue to the one that is (AttachThreadInput) -- the standard way, and the only one that needs no
    //   change to the game. POSIX: X11 through dlopen (no new link line), both windows found by _NET_WM_PID in
    //   _NET_CLIENT_LIST, the front one read from _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW and the other asked for with the same

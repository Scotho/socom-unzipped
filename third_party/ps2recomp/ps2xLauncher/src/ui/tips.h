// Issue #74 (owner, 2026-09-26: "launcher controller buttons on hover should show a tooltip for what they do"):
// a one-line tooltip for a control, in the launcher's own voice -- what it does and, where it applies, what its
// current value means. Two ways to see it: the mouse resting on a control for kTipDelaySeconds draws it beside
// the control, and the keyboard or pad focus puts the same line in the bottom bar, so a pad-driven launcher gets
// the text too.
//
// This is not focus.h's helpFor. That is the two-line "?" answer in the title strip, for the few controls a
// stranger has a real question about; this is the one line EVERY control on a page carries.
//
// The strings live with the page that draws the control, one table per page (page_<slug>_tips.cpp beside
// page_<slug>.cpp). Each table is pure -- no raylib -- so a test walks the page's own focus list and holds
// every control to a line. A page without its own file has an empty table: the mechanism is there, and the
// footer and the hover simply show nothing for it.

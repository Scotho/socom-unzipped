// SOCOM II VU1 image d418194495c25213, entry pc 0x1b50: the command dispatcher and the handlers
// its "family A" (UI quad / 2D), "family B" (clipped world objects) and "family C" (either of
// those plus an inline GIF block and a second draw pass) command lists use.
//
// Structure, command encoding, register roles and the hand-back rules: docs/research/12-vu1-entry0-ui-path.md
// section (f) for family A, docs/research/13-vu1-family-b-world-objects.md for families B and C,
// the 0x3618 clipper and the shared packet-flush tail. Contract: emit exactly the GIF packets the
// microcode emits and leave the register file and VU data memory exactly as the microcode leaves
// them (verified by `vu1_replay --verify --native`, --regs all).
//
// Sprint-2 addition: PS2X_VU1_HOST_DRAW=1 makes command 0x28 draw each assembled triangle through
// GS::submitHostTriangle instead of XGKICKing its packet (see submitHostTriangleFromPacket). The
// packet is still assembled byte for byte, so the contract above is unchanged with the knob on --
// only the kick is replaced. `vu1_replay --vram-diff` compares the two renderings pixel for pixel.
// The hook falls back to the real kick for anything it cannot reproduce exactly, which now
// includes two cases the GIF path handles differently rather than not at all: a PRIM with FST set
// (UV in texel units, where the hook feeds S/T/Q) and a vertex whose FTOI4 X or Y word is outside
// 0..65535, which PACKED XYZF2 wraps at 16 bits and the host path's float would not.
//
// What runs natively: command lists whose decode from data qword 340 contains only command words
// this file implements and terminates on 0x42 (END) -- all seven family-A commands, all seven
// family-B ones (0x02, 0x0a, 0x12, 0x56, 0x1a, 0x2a, 0x4c, with the 0x3618 clipper and the 0x1980
// flush tail behind them), all six of family C's (0x64, 0x72, 0x74, 0x30, 0x32, 0x34) and, of the
// fourth family, 0x70 and 0x40 (research/15) -- which makes its two drawing shapes
// `70 06 08 40 42` and `70 08 40 42` fully native. "Decode" is
// not "linear decode" any more: 0x30 and 0x32 embed eight-qword GIF packets in the list itself and
// 0x34 an eleven-qword one, and all three advance vi14 past them, so the pre-scan applies that
// rewrite as it walks (scanCommandList).
//
// Two command words are still missing, and a list containing either of them hands back WHOLE at
// 0x1b50 before this file touches any state, so the generated microcode translation runs it
// exactly as before. Over the 166-run dispatcher corpus that residual is four programs:
//   * 0x52 (0x3100) and 0x66 (0x2e28), the skinning half of the fourth family, four programs.
//     Both are scope decisions with reasons, not gaps waiting to be filled -- see
//     isFamilyDCommand.
//
// Within a family-A list the handlers are mutually independent (each re-derives its pointers from
// vi1). Family B is not: vi8 and vi10 (the clipped polygon and its vertex count, set inside
// 0x3618) cross every 0x02 -> 0x0a -> ... -> 0x2a edge, and vi12/vi15 (the primitive counter and
// the index cursor) cross the 0x4c back edge (research/13 6.2). That does not change the
// hand-back rule here, because this file reproduces the whole register file and all of VU data
// memory bit for bit: a command it cannot run hands back at 0x1b60 -- the pc at which the
// microcode reads the next command word -- and the microcode resumes from exact state. With every
// A and B command implemented that path is a safety net rather than a live one.
//
// An asymmetry in how the pre-scan treats that vi10: it requires 0x02 to have been walked before
// 0x2a, 0x4c or 0x32, but NOT before the four shims 0x0a, 0x12, 0x56 and 0x1a, which read vi10
// just as much. That is historical -- Task 5 added the requirement for the commands that end a
// primitive and Task 6 for 0x32, and this task made both order-based -- and it is left alone
// deliberately: on a list without 0x02 the shims are exactly what the microcode would run, on
// whatever vi10 the previous program left, and reproducing that is the contract. What was missing
// was a bound on the work, not a bound on the shape, and the vi10 clamps supply it: those loops
// exit on `> 0` or `!= 0` against a 16-bit register, so kMaxClippedVertices is what keeps a stale
// vi10 from being 65535 iterations. 0x2a and 0x4c keep their shape requirement because a stale
// vi10 there means a stale *packet* kicked at the GS, not just wasted work.
//
// Once a list is taken over it runs to its E bit: `budgetEnd` and `m_stopRequested` are ignored,
// because 0x1b60 is the only pc this program could legally stop at and stopping there buys
// nothing. That is only defensible while a list's work is bounded, and the counts that bound it
// (TOP+2.z vertices, TOP+2.w triangles, the latter also family B's primitive counter, plus 0x34's
// block count N) are guest
// data, not something the microcode validates -- a header with z = 32767 would mean ~11k
// template-fill iterations and up to 32767 uninterruptible XGKICKs. So the pre-scan checks them
// too, against a ceiling with plenty of margin over the corpus maxima: see kMaxVertices /
// kMaxTriangles. A header outside that range hands the list back whole, exactly like a family-C
// one.
//
// THE PER-HANDLER CLAMPS. The pre-scan's header check is not the only place those bounds are
// enforced. Every handler re-checks the count it is about to loop on, as its first statement,
// against kMaxVertices (TOP+2.z: 0x0b28, 0x0e08, 0x0f90, 0x05e0, 0x1458, 0x22b8, 0x26a8),
// kMaxTriangles (TOP+2.w: 0x1640, 0x17d0, 0x1f78) or kMaxClippedVertices (vi10: 0x0f38, 0x1120,
// 0x0650, 0x15d0, 0x1a98, 0x23d0). A violation hands the command back to the microcode at 0x1b60 with vi14 naming
// it again -- the same clean hand-back a command with no handler gets, which is why every clamp
// sits before its handler has written a register, stored a qword or kicked anything.
//   * For family A that is a hand-back research/12 already licenses at any command boundary.
//   * For family B the only boundary research/13 6.3 licenses outright is "immediately before
//     0x02 is dispatched", and that is exactly where the primitive-count clamp sits (0x1f78);
//     6.3 calls everything after it one indivisible unit for a program that reproduces only
//     vi1/vi14. So the clamps that sit *inside* a family-B list -- the vi10 ones -- are placed
//     ahead of their handler's first instruction and are unreachable on any accepted list:
//     vi10 comes from this file's own clipper, whose ping-pong buffers cap it at twelve, and the
//     pre-scan refuses a family-B list that could reach a shim without 0x02 having run. The
//     escape hatch the brief's other option would need -- finishing the primitive and stopping at
//     the 0x4c boundary -- is not taken, because 6.3 does not license that boundary either; the
//     list is refused before it starts instead (see the family-B clauses in isNativeRun).
//   * Commands 0x30, 0x32 and 0x34 check *both* their own per-vertex count and the count of the
//     draw handler they tail-jump into, at their own entry, because after their first XGKICK a
//     hand-back would replay the inline block. 0x32's and 0x34's checks are two-sided: their
//     per-vertex loops end on `!= 0`, so a count of zero is 65536 wrapping stores, and a 0x4c back
//     edge can reach a 0x32 with the zero the clipper's "clipped away entirely" path leaves.
//     0x34 additionally refuses any block count but 1 (cmdSphereMapBlock).
//
// On real data a clamp cannot fire, because the pre-scan reads the same two header words first
// and vi10 is bounded by the clipper that produced it. That is a property of the data, not of the
// code, so the clamps are exercised in `./build.sh test` through two TEST-ONLY environment knobs,
// PS2X_VU1_NATIVE_TEST_CEILING and PS2X_VU1_NATIVE_TEST_CLIP_CEILING, which lower the
// handler-side ceilings and leave the pre-scan's alone (see vertexCeiling / triangleCeiling /
// clippedVertexCeiling). Nothing in the game sets either, and both can only narrow.
//
// CAVEAT on any mid-list hand-back, clamp or otherwise: this file commits FMAC flags immediately
// (see commitFmacFlags) instead of queueing them for the interpreter's four-deep flag pipeline.
// At the E bit that is identical, because the interpreter flushes its queues in issue order. It
// is NOT identical at 0x1b60: the microcode resumes with m_state.mac holding the newest FMAC's
// flags, where hardware would still have an older entry in flight, so microcode whose next FMAND
// is within four pairs of the boundary would read a newer MAC than hardware. No handler in this
// image has an FMAND that close to 0x1b60 -- the only two are the cull's at 0x1718 and the
// clipper's pair inside 0x3ad0, all of them many pairs into their own command -- so the path is
// dead. It is stated because it is the one respect in which a hand-back from this file is not
// bit-exact, and a new handler could wake it.
//
// The program also requires the interpreter's default XGKICK model, which copies the whole packet
// at kick time. Under PS2X_VU1_XGKICK_CYCLE_EXACT=1 a kick streams as m_cycle advances and a new
// kick clears whatever is still in flight; this program never advances m_cycle, so command 0x28's
// back-to-back per-triangle kicks would silently drop packets. That mode therefore hands back
// whole as well.
//
// A consequence of never advancing m_cycle: a natively-run list consumes zero VU cycles, so to
// DMAC/VIF timing VU1 appears to finish instantaneously, and the cycles/s field of [vu1-stats]
// under-reports by whatever those lists would have cost on the microcode path.

    // software-pipelined two-vertices-per-iteration loop, same in-place stores over the three-qword
    // records at TOP+4, same thirteen registers. Only the position conversion differs:
    //
    //   0x68   record[0] -> (ITOF4 (.xyz) + TOP+3.xyz, ITOF15(.w))   12.4 local coords + an offset
    //   0x70   record[0] -> (ITOF15(.xyz) * TOP+3.w,   ITOF15(.w))   1.15 coords * an object scale
    //
    // record[1] (ITOF12 on .xy, ITOF15 on .zw) and record[2] (ITOF0) are byte-identical to 0x68's.
    // Note the position's .w lane is ITOF15 in BOTH and is written after the multiply, so it is
    // never scaled -- it carries the vertex normal's x (research/15 4.4).
    //
    // Diffing the full 40 pairs of 0x0b20-0x0c58 against 0x0cb8-0x0df0 gives 30 identical and 10
    // differing: the eight substitution sites above, the prologue's `IADDIU vi3, vi3, 6` two pairs
    // earlier, and the relocated loop head (0x0bd0 -> 0x0d68). The cursor move is scheduling only
    // and is transcribed at its real position below for the sake of the disassembly line numbers.
    // The invariant that makes it inert is NOT "every LQ that uses vi3 follows it" -- the prologue
    // loads at 0x0cd0-0x0cf8 precede it, in this handler and in 0x68 -- it is that NOTHING between
    // the two candidate positions reads vi3 at all: the increment sits at 0x0d18 here and at
    // 0x0b98's counterpart 0x0d30 in 0x68's schedule, and the pairs in between (0x0d20's ITOF0 and
    // the two MULw.xyz) touch only vf registers. So the two orders are the same program.
    //
    // Only TOP+3's .w lane is read here -- poisoning .x or .y changes nothing, poisoning .w changes
    // the packets -- but the whole quad is loaded, because vf27 is compared state.
    //
    // Like 0x68 this reads one pair of records past the end of the array and leaves their
    // conversion in the register file on exit. That is not an accident of the transcription: nine
    // of the thirteen registers hold that over-read pair at the hand-back, and `--regs all`

    // same PACKED (ST, RGBAQ, XYZF2) x 3 with PRE set that 0x28's TOP+1 template carries, and the
    // same NLOOP patch to 3 -- except that its PRIM is 0x4B rather than 0x7B: TME 0 and FGE 0,
    // i.e. untextured and unfogged.
    //
    // The other is the trap. 0x40 enters PAST 0x1780's `LQ vf20, 38(vi0)`, so the RGBAQ
    // computation that 0x1790's ADDAw and 0x1880's MADD perform runs on a vf20 INHERITED from
    // whatever handler ran before it -- there is no vf20 of 0x40's own. In all 38 dispatches that
    // handler is 0x08, whose software-pipelined loop exits with vf20 holding one qword past the
    // end of the vertex block, data[TOP+4 + 3*(TOP+2.z + 2)]; in every one of the 38 that lands
    // inside the index list, on four small integers which reinterpreted as floats are denormals,
    // which the VU flushes to zero. Hence ACC.xyz = 0, R' = G' = B' = 0, and A' = A * qword 327.w:
    // 798 packets, 2394 vertices, exactly one distinct (R,G,B) triple in the whole corpus, (0,0,0).
    //
    // None of that is hardcoded here, deliberately. The inheritance is reproduced instead -- this
    // handler does not load vf20, and buildPacketBody computes ACC.xyz from the inherited vf20.w
    // before 0x17d8 overwrites vf20.w from qword 327, exactly as the microcode does -- because
    // "RGB comes out black" is a property of this corpus's data, not of the microcode, and the
    // first list that puts a different handler in front of 0x40 would break a shortcut. The
    // denormal flush is the interpreter's own: fmac normalises its vft operand through
    // vu1ops::normalize4, the same normalizeOperand semantics the microcode path uses, so the
    // zeros are produced rather than assumed.
    //
    // Everything else -- the index walk, the two visibility gates, the 290/300 ping-pong and its

    // TEST_1, CLAMP_1) followed by five qwords that never reach the GS and are read with LQ as

    //     +10     (UV scale, rim offset, -, rim slope) -> vf23, loaded .xyw only
    //

    // staging array the rest of family A writes:
    //     V  = position - eye                      R  = V - 2 dot(V, N) N          (N = the
    //     R' = R in the (vf17, vf18, vf19) basis        packed normal, (pos.w, uv.z, uv.w))

    //     A  = (1 + block[9].w) * colour.w/128 * ramp(R'.z)      -> staging[+1] (whole RGBAQ)

    // R'.z >= 0.
    //
    // Two things in here are decided by the code rather than by the algebra:
    //
    // * THE SAME-LANE WRITE CONFLICT AT pc 0x2760. That pair is
    //       upper  ADDx.w vf27, vf0, vf30x   ->  vf27.w = 1.0f + vf30.x
    //       lower  MR32.w  vf27, vf30        ->  vf27.w = vf30.x
    //   -- both halves writing vf27.w, one 1.0f apart. The UPPER WINS: the interpreter's pair
    //   decoder sets decoded.suppressedLowerVf when the lower's vf write names the upper's
    //   destination register, and `hasLowerWrite` then drops the lower's queueVfWrite entirely
    //   (ps2_vu1_core.cpp); the generated translation's L_0x2760 emits the ADDx.w and no
    //   execLower at all. research/15 6.4 also separates the two hypotheses by experiment -- with
    //   block[9].w patched to 0 the measured alpha is non-zero, which only the upper produces.
    //   So this handler emits the FMAC and no MR32. The suppression is register-granular, not
    //   lane-granular, so there is deliberately no lane merge here.
    //
    // * N > 1 IS REFUSED, by the pre-scan and again below. vi5 holds the block's base address
    //   for the XGKICK at 0x26f8, is computed ONCE at 0x26b0 outside the outer loop, and is then
    //   overwritten with the constant 32 at 0x2848 -- the FMAND mask -- on the first pass through
    //   the inner loop. A second outer iteration would therefore kick data qword 32 and read its
    //   five parameter qwords from 38..42, not re-kick the block. (research/15 6.2's last bullet
    //   says it would "re-kick the same block"; that is wrong, and the note is corrected in the
    //   same commit as this handler.) Since that target is not in the command list, the scan can
    //   never have validated its GIFtag, so N != 1 hands the list back whole. N was 1 in the only

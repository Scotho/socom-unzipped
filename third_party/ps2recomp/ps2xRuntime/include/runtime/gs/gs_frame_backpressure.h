// Back-pressure between the thread that records a GPU backend's GS command stream (the EE
// executor, once per guest VBlankStart) and the thread that replays it (the GL/main thread, once
// per host frame). Sprint 5 ruling R35: without it the recorder runs vsync-paced at 60 guest
// frames/s whatever the replay costs, so when replay is slower (SP gameplay, ~14 frames/s) the
// pending command buffer grows without bound (275 MB -> 13 GB in 4 min) and every host frame
// drains a larger backlog (stall-report.md).
//
// Policy: after recording frame k, the recorder waits while more than maxPendingFrames frames are
// recorded but not yet replayed. The cap bounds how long the consumer may make NO progress
// (ruling R40): the consumer bumps a heartbeat (consumerProgress) while it executes, so a live GL
// thread replaying a big batch keeps the recorder waiting past the cap. Only a consumer silent for
// the whole cap (window drag in the modal pump, hang, exit) latches "consumer stalled": frames then
// do not wait, and the latch clears on the next heartbeat or completed replay. So a stuck GL
// thread costs one cap, not one cap per frame. release() ends all waiting for good (shutdown).
// maxPendingFrames == 0 is unbounded (the pre-R35 behaviour); PS2X_GS_MAX_PENDING_FRAMES sets it.

// Sprint 7 Task 1b (audit 2026-09-17 section 2.2 F3, gap G7): the byte side of the same queue.
// GsFrameBackpressure bounds how many guest FRAMES may be recorded ahead of the replay, but once
// the consumer latches stalled (a title-bar drag holds the GL thread in the modal size-move loop
// for as long as the mouse is down) frames stop waiting and the pending command buffer used to
// grow for the whole drag (the ~15 GB working set KNOWN section 4 recorded before Sprint 7).
// GsPendingCap bounds it in bytes instead.
//
// Policy: while the consumer is latched, a command that carries no state (draw work: it will be
// re-submitted next guest frame) is dropped once the pending bytes reach the cap; a command that
// carries state (an upload, a transfer, a CLUT load, a VRAM write, anything the replay cannot
// reconstruct from the queue alone) is never dropped -- from Sprint 10 Goal 11 (Q6) on it is
// ABSORBED past the cap instead of pended: GsStallCoalescer (gs_stall_coalescer.h) remembers where
// it wrote and re-anchors the replay from the game thread's VRAM when the latch clears, so the
// queue stays at the cap plus one command for as long as the stall lasts and no drag can corrupt
// what the game draws after it. Nothing is ever dropped or absorbed while the consumer is live.
// capBytes == 0 is unbounded (the pre-1b behaviour, and the coalescer never engages);
// PS2X_GS_PENDING_CAP_MB sets it, default 64 MB.
//
// The counters are atomic: admit() runs on the recorder's thread (under the queue lock) and the
// stats line reads them on the render thread.
// Sprint 8 Goal 5, ruling R124: before Q6 the soft cap dropped only state-free draw work, so a
// replay that stayed latched for minutes still grew without bound on the state-carrying commands
// it could never drop (KNOWN's "GsPendingCap::admit keeps every state-carrying command unbounded",
// which ended in std::bad_alloc on the 8 GB VM). R124's answer was a HARD ceiling the RECORDER
// waits at: above hardCapBytes the recorder blocks until the replay drains the queue, whatever the
// latch says. It stays as the last line -- for a replay that is merely slow (unlatched, so the
// coalescer never engages) and for PS2X_GS_PENDING_CAP_MB=0 -- but a latched stall no longer
// reaches it. mustWait() is the pure predicate; the waiting itself lives in GSGlBackend::record,
// which owns the queue mutex and the condition variable the replay notifies.
// hardCapBytes == 0 is no ceiling; PS2X_GS_PENDING_HARD_CAP_MB sets it, default 1024 MB.

// Sprint 9 Goal 1: what the game's exit code means -- decided once, for the runner that leaves with it
// and the launcher that reads it. Header-only and free of every other header in this tree, so
// ps2xRuntime, ps2xLauncher and ps2xTest can all include it; tools_py/exit_codes.py reads the table
// below with a regex, so a row's shape is part of the contract:
//
//     X(Name, <decimal code>, "slug", "One plain sentence, at most 120 characters, no double quote.")
//
// Rules (tools_py/tests/test_exit_codes_table.py and the ExitCodes suite enforce them): a code fits a
// byte, stays outside the shell's 126-165, is used once, and 65 keeps the meaning Sprint 7 gave it.
// 1 and 3 are not new: they are what this process already leaves with, given a name and a sentence.
//
// A crash has no row the runner ever returns. The Windows vectored handler and the Linux sigaction
// handler (game_overrides_socom2.cpp) print their report and let the process die the native way --
// an NT status such as 0xC0000005, or a signal the launcher reads as 128 + n -- and classify() folds
// those onto kCrashed for whoever reads the status (R128).

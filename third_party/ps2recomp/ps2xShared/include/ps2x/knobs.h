#pragma once

// Sprint 9 Goal 3: every PS2X_* environment name the shipped executables read, decided once. This table
// IS the accessor's lookup (ps2x::knob), the source of docs/KNOBS.md (tools_py/knobs.py reads the rows with
// a regex, so a row's shape is part of the contract) and the launcher's list of settings:
//
//     X("PS2X_NAME", Class, Kind, "default", "One line, at most 110 characters, no double quote.")
//
// Rows are sorted by name in strcmp order (find() is a binary search; the Knobs suite and
// tools_py/tests/test_knobs_registry.py both check it). Adding a getenv of a PS2X_* name anywhere in
// ps2xRuntime, ps2xIOP, ps2xShared or ps2xLauncher without a row here fails the Python suite, and so does a
// row nothing reads.
//
// Class:  Shipping  a player-facing setting; launcher::Config has a field behind it; always honoured.
//         Dev       a probe, trace, dump or A/B switch; honoured only in developer mode (--dev on the runner's
//                   command line, or PS2X_DEV=1). A stranger's environment cannot switch one on.
//         Test      read by ps2x_tests only, never by a shipped executable.
//         Switch    PS2X_DEV itself.
// Kind:   Flag      read with ps2x::knobOn -- unset or empty is the default; 0, false, off are false; anything
//                   else is true.
//         Presence  any value, including 0, switches it on (traces; see docs/KNOBS.md).
//         Int, Float, Text, Path, Spec   parsed where they are read. A Path a stranger sets must lie under the
//                   game folder or it reads as unset (pathInsideHome, R204); the disc image is the exception.

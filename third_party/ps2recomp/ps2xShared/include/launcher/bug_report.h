// Sprint 9 Goal 8: the launcher's REPORT A BUG page and the ONLINE page's status line, as pure functions.
// The service is the owner's own site (s2u.scotho.com); its client-side reference is sites/s2u/src/report.ts
// (checkForm, buildPayload, replyText) and its inbox sites/s2u/api/bugs.mjs -- the field names, the limits and
// the wording here mirror those two files. Nothing in this header opens a socket: the transport lives in the
// launcher's glues (win32glue::httpRequest), and nothing leaves the machine until SEND is pressed.
//
// Privacy is Goal 1's machinery (launcher/diagnostics.h): the context comes from an allowlist of Config
// fields, the ISO is cut to its file name, the log is clipLog + scrub(homeDir) and then the contract's last
// 65,536 bytes. There is no credential in Config, and the memory card is never read.

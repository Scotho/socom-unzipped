"""What scripts/vm_sync.sh tree must delete in the guest: files under the synced roots that the host no
longer has. Reads the guest's list on stdin, prints the stale paths; the host's list comes from the tree.

The host's side is `git ls-files` AND a walk of the same roots (Sprint 11 Task 18). git alone would delete
an operator's untracked scratch file from the guest on the next sync; the walk alone missed nothing but was
never asked about docs/, so when fourteen documents moved into docs/archive/ on 2026-09-22 the guest kept
both copies and `python3 -m tools_py.docmaint` failed on every duplicate in the VM.

ROOTS is what may be pruned: the source trees, docs/, tests/ and ghidra_scripts/ -- all of them fully
tracked directories that the tar sends whole. Everything the tar does NOT send is refused outright
(EXCLUDED), so a guest build tree, its logs, its keys, its .git or its extracted disc can never be named
here however the lists are shaped. Root-level files are not pruned: the walk does not descend from the
root, and a renamed README is not the failure this guards.

And there is a floor. "The host has nothing" reads as "delete everything" to stale(), so a host list that
cannot be trusted -- a root missing its directories, an empty list, fewer paths than FLOOR, no README.md
-- stops the run with a sentence instead of producing a longer list (see refuse()). This is the only
thing in the VM ring that deletes, and scripts/vm_sync.sh pipes its output straight into
`xargs -0 rm -f --` behind nothing but `[ -s ]`.

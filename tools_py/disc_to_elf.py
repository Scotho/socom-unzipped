"""From your own SOCOM II disc to a buildable ELF -- the one command (Sprint 10, 2026-09-21).

    bash scripts/disc_to_elf.sh "<path to your SOCOM II ISO>" [--out game]
    python -m tools_py.disc_to_elf "<path to your SOCOM II ISO>" [--out game]

`./build.sh recomp` starts from four files this repository does not and must not contain: the
extracted disc tree (`game/disc/`, and `game/disc/SCUS_972.75` in particular) and the two plaintext
overlays merged into one image (`game/overlays/{ftscore.bin,zsealetc.bin,socom2_game.elf}`). Until
today the sequence that produces them existed only as three research scripts and a memory of the
order they were run in, once, on the maintainer's machine (`CONTRIBUTING.md` said so). This module is
that sequence, in four stages, each of which

  * is skipped when its output is already on disk and already right (so a second run is a no-op that
    still verifies -- re-run it as often as you like, and after an interrupted run);
  * checks its output against `tools_py/disc_to_elf_expected.json`, the recorded sizes, sha256 digests
    and addresses of the r0001 disc -- facts *about* the disc, not its content;
  * refuses with an exit code out of `ps2x/exit_codes.h` where one fits, and always with a sentence
    you can act on.

The stages, with what they cost on the machine they were measured on (2026-09-21, an ISO on a local
SSD):

  1. extract    the ISO9660 filesystem to `<out>/disc/`                4.1 GB, about 2 minutes
  2. dnas       `OVERLAY/REL/DNAS.BIN` -> `DNAS.dec.bin`               about 1 minute
                (`dnas_selfdecrypt.py`: the DNAS overlay's ~130 self-encrypting code blocks, run
                 through their own cipher under Unicorn)
  3. overlays   `RUN/RAW/APACHE00.ZDB` -> `<out>/overlays/*.bin`       about 7 minutes
                (`decrypt_apache.py`: the retail loader's own decryption code under Unicorn)
  4. elf        the loader + the two overlays -> `socom2_game.elf`     seconds
                (`make_overlay_elf.py`, exactly as `build.sh recomp` calls it)

Stages 2 and 3 emulate R5900 code, so they need Unicorn (`pip install unicorn`; 2.1.4 is what this
was measured with) and they are slow -- their chatter goes to `<out>/disc_to_elf-<stage>.log`
rather than your terminal. Everything else is plain Python; no 7z, no external extractor.

Nothing here writes inside the ISO or needs it after stage 1, and nothing writes outside `--out`.

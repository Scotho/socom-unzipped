"""PLAYTEST's build block, rendered from make_portable's manifest (Sprint 14 Task D5).

`python -m tools_py.playtest_block [--manifest PATH] [--check]` rewrites the text between `<!-- build:begin -->`
and `<!-- build:end -->` in docs/PLAYTEST.md from the manifest scripts/make_portable.sh writes last, beside the
build it packaged (`dist/manifest.json` by default): the archive, its sha256, the runner's sha256, the commit and
branch it was built from, when, and whether the tree was dirty. With no manifest the block says **NOT BUILT** and
how to build. Either way the exit is 0: the point is that the block always says the truth. `--check` exits 1 when
the block on disk differs from a fresh render and writes nothing; 2 is a page without the markers or a manifest
that cannot be read.

The render does not depend on the day (`today` is accepted and unused), so `--check` never goes stale overnight;
it goes stale only when a build lands or goes away. scripts/parity/playtest_block.sh is the chain step that builds
and then runs this. The sitting page's reader (tools_py/sitting.py, D3) takes the block between the same markers.

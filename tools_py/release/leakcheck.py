"""The gate that decides whether this repository may face outward -- one command, exit non-zero on any hit.

    python -m tools_py.release.leakcheck tree               every tracked file, as it is in the working tree
    python -m tools_py.release.leakcheck staged             what `git commit` is about to take (the pre-commit hook)
    python -m tools_py.release.leakcheck ignored            the paths that hold the real secrets are ignored,
                                                            untracked, and were never committed
    python -m tools_py.release.leakcheck metadata           every commit's author and committer identity
    python -m tools_py.release.leakcheck history [REV..]    every added line of every commit on every ref
    python -m tools_py.release.leakcheck artifact <dir>     an unpacked release archive, or any directory
    python -m tools_py.release.leakcheck external [--require]   the SIBLING repositories' own scanners
    python -m tools_py.release.leakcheck all                tree + ignored + metadata + history + external

Exit codes -- three states, not two: **0** clean, **1** findings, **2** the scanner did not run (a missing
target, a shallow clone in history mode, or the planted control it runs on itself first was missed). A gate
that treats "could not scan" as "nothing found" is worse than no gate, because it reports safety it did not
measure -- so a caller must never read 2 as a pass.

Output is `path:line: rule: <masked excerpt>` on stderr, and `--json` writes one object (`tool`, `target`,
`scanned`, `self_test`, `findings`, `exit`) whose excerpts are masked exactly as the terminal's are: a
machine-readable report is MORE likely to be pasted, logged or attached, not less. `--reveal` prints the
matched text unmasked on the terminal only, for whoever is fixing the hit.

The `external` mode is the sixth leg: three repositories publish from this machine, and the other two carry
their own scanners (`../scotho`'s `scripts/check-secrets.mjs`, `../socom_monitor`'s `leakcheck.py`). It calls
them where they are beside this one and folds their findings into this report, masked. It distinguishes two
ways of not scanning, because only one of them is anybody's fault: a sibling that is simply *absent* (or whose
build output or runtime is) prints SKIPPED and leaves the exit code alone -- CI has neither repository -- while
a sibling that IS there and whose scanner could not scan is exit 2, flags or no flags. `--require` turns the
first into exit 2 as well, for a machine that is supposed to have them. Neither ever prints as clean.

Decisions live in `leak_allow.txt` beside this file (a rule, a path glob, an optional literal, and the reason),
so an allowed hit is a reviewed line in a tracked file and not a comment in the code. Owner-specific literals
live in the git-ignored `leak_extra.txt` (`leakrules.EXTRA_FILE`). Sprint 11 Goal 9 is the design; Sprint 10
pulled it forward the day the repository went public.

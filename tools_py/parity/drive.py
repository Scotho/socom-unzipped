Script lines: `<mode>+<delay>:<BTN>[+<BTN>]` with mode `stable` (wait until the frame has been
stable for --settle seconds, at most --maxwait, then wait <delay>), `long` (as `stable` with a
150 s cap, for screens behind a slow cinematic), `next` (first wait for the screen to change

<delay> s), `until(x0,y0,x1,y1)` (press until that box is highlighted) or `wait` (just wait <delay>);
BTN `NONE` presses nothing. A screenshot `sNN_<btn>.png` is taken right before each press, and a
`wNN_<k>.png` every second of every wait within step NN (so a fade that never settles is still
captured); `manifest.json` records the step, wall time since launch, stability wait and whether the frame

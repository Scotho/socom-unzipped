"""Why the native VU1 dispatcher refuses, read from a run log (Sprint 17 F, research/81 §3.4).

What is read. Under PS2X_VU1_NATIVE_REFUSALS=1 (Dev) the runtime prints, once a second, one line per refusal key
whose counters moved in the interval (runtime/vu1_native_refusals.h):

    [vu1-refuse] elapsed=1002ms entry=0x1b50 reason=unknown_command cmd=0x52 n=37 cycles=412345 host_us=5120

n= refusals, cycles= the VU cycles the fallback (generated code or the interpreter) then ran for them, host_us= its
host time, all deltas over the interval. cmd= is `-`, a command word, or for no_native_entry at entry 0 the
entry-0 program's path (`kick`, `matrix`, `fade`, `list`, `fade+list`, `none`: research/83 section 3.1), so --by key
gives one row per path. vu1_replay prints the running totals once, at its end, in the same fields:

    [vu1-refuse-total] entry=0x1b50 reason=unknown_command cmd=0x52 n=4 cycles=51234 host_us=610

A log holding total lines is read from those alone (they already sum everything); otherwise the interval lines are
summed. A window (--from/--to, sampler seconds, or --stamp <gate stamp dir> for the scripted walk) keeps the
interval lines whose preceding `[pc-sampler]` row falls inside it, frame_time's idiom for a clock-less line.

    python -m tools_py.parity.vu1_refusals <log> [--by reason|key] [--from <t>] [--to <t>] [--stamp <dir>]

prints a table -- reason (or entry/reason/cmd), entries, share of all refusals, cycles, share of all fallback
cycles, host ms -- sorted by cycles, then a total row, then a WARNING line when an `overflow=` line says the key
table was full (the rows are short by that many refusals); exits 1 when the log has no refusal line. A last line
without its newline (a log cut off, or read while written) is not read.

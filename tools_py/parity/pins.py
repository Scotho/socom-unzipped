"""Pinned inputs: the record of what a measurement was computed against, and the refusal when it drifted.

Sprint 10 Q1b. A gate's summary.txt used to pin one thing, the EXE line, while everything else the score
depends on -- the reference images, the memory card the run boots from, the drive scripts, the harness
revision, the PS2X_* environment -- could change with no record. A silently-changed reference image moves
every score with nothing saying that anything moved: the sibling of HANDOFF trap 4 (the pipeline cannot see
a defect present in every run; it cannot see a change in its own standard either).

This module is the mechanism and knows nothing about the gate: `gate.collect_pins` names the gate's set, and
Q3b's mapping hash rides the same code. A `Pin` is a name, a sha256 (None when the input is missing or
absent) and a human detail. A file pins as its content hash; a directory as the sha256 of its sorted manifest
(`<relative path>\\0<file sha256>\\n` per file, so a rename, a byte or an extra file all move it); an
environment as the sorted `NAME=value` lines of its PS2X_* variables, minus PS2X_MC_DIR (the card's PATH is
not an input, its CONTENTS are, and those are the card pin); the harness as the manifest of the tracked files
of its trees plus the git revision for the record.

`compare` reads a committed expected-pins file (EXPECTED, `{"pins": {name: sha256}}`) and names every
drift: a changed value, a pinned name the run no longer has, an input the run has that the file does not
(an "unpinned" input: a reference sibling that appeared, or the first run that prints the mapping hash).
RECORD_ONLY names are written on every summary and never compared: the file cannot name the revision of the
tree that holds it. A pin whose sha256 is None is absent, not drifted (the mapping line before Q3b lands).

Summary lines are `PIN <name> sha256=<hex> ok|DRIFTED (expected <hex>)|accepted (was <hex>)|recorded (...)`
and `PIN <name> absent (...)`, beside the EXE line, in the same shape.

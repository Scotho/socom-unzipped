"""One command for the three screenshot gates. PASS/FAIL per gate, exit 1 on any FAIL.

  python -m tools_py.parity.gate                     # all three (title ~3 min, transition ~3 min, mission ~11 min)

  python -m tools_py.parity.gate --score-mission logs/parity/drive_gameplay_probe5.txt

Runs go to logs/parity/gate/<stamp>/<gate>/ with the drive log beside them and a summary.txt.
Must be run from the repo root (drive.py uses relative paths). Takes scripts/loop_lock.sh.

Refuses to start (exit 3) when C: has less than RUN_MIN_FREE_GB (default 4) free -- Sprint 5 R46/A5:
a launch or a gate run must not be the thing that fills a drive already near capacity. `free_gb()` is
the injectable seam for tests (mock.patch.object(gate, "free_gb", ...)); RUN_FREE_GB_CMD overrides the
query itself with a shell command whose last stdout line is the free space in GB, the same override
scripts/run_detached.sh honours for its own disk refusal. `--score-title`/`--score-mission` (re-score
an existing run, no game launch, nothing large written) are exempt.

The gate states what it measured (Sprint 10 Q1b). Beside the EXE line, summary.txt carries one `PIN <name>
sha256=<hex> ...` line per pinned input -- every reference image and drive script the three stages read
(pinned_files, derived from the scripts and the scorers), the memory card the run boots from, the PS2X_*
environment, the harness revision (record only) and, once the runtime prints it, the input mapping hash --
and a run's pins.json beside it. The committed standard is scripts/parity/pins.json; a launch whose pins do
not match it is REFUSED before anything is launched (exit 7, distinct from a stage FAIL's 1), and so is a
`--baseline` re-score whose recorded pins, or today's reference files, do not match. `--accept-pins` makes the
measured values the standard, written once after the run (the summary says so; a gate the lock refuses
writes nothing -- issue #45); `--pins` is the lock-free dry check.

A run with the mission stage also carries `FRAME mean=<ms> worst1s=<ms> n=<VBlanks>` (Sprint 13 V4): VBlank
pacing -- host ms per guest VBlank, a lower bound on the time between presents, not the present rate (docs/
KNOWN.md §1's two-instance clock row keeps the two apart) -- over the scripted walk (the HUD step to the drive's
last step), from the sampler rows of mission.game.log (tools_py/parity/frame_time.py says which fields and
why), and records the numbers in its pins.json as an informational
`PIN frame` that is never compared (S13-R3: no refusal until three gates agree on its spread).

A launch refuses (exit 5, REFUSE_STALE) when the exe is older than the newest file it is built from (freshness_roots;
Sprint 14 E4); `--stale-ok` proceeds and the summary says so. Every summary and pins.json carries `TREE <head>
dirty=<n>` -- the tree the gate measured.

A fourth leg (Sprint 14 E2) scores a finished stamp against frozen references and launches nothing:
  python -m tools_py.parity.gate --capture-heldout logs/parity/gate/<green stamp>   # once, exit 9 if refused
  python -m tools_py.parity.gate --leg heldout logs/parity/gate/<stamp>             # 0 only at 12/12; 6 before
the captures. See LEG_REFS_DIR below; the name appears in this file and the merged-chain template only.

# title run gives 1/36 (negative control, logs/parity/runs/gameplay_probe5).
# [SUPERSEDED 2026-09-25 by the issue #30 block below: the verdict is no longer a count. The three
# captures of headroom sat inside the menu, not at the tail (s7_cpu_fallback2 lost s16..s18 and passed),
# and the "~3 points" band is 2.0 on the full record (lowest window capture 92.0, research/64 command G).
# The scores and the fade/movie reading above still stand.]
#
# Issue #30 (research/64, 2026-09-25): s19..s22 are not menu screens that were lost -- they are the game's idle
# attract sequence (the menu fading to black, then the mission flyovers), already named in the calibration
# above. Of the 165 archived stamps with a title line (native_on 2026-09-10 .. s11_close_gate), 123 score
# exactly 19/23, 7 score 20-21/23 (the attract a capture late) and 14 score 23/23 (no attract inside the
# window; s8_audio_mc_gate2, the issue's "before", is one of those). The count bar hid the one real loss on
# record: s7_cpu_fallback2 froze on the menu-over-black from s16 on (s16..s22 = 82.7-82.9) and PASSED at 16/23.
# So the verdict is positional: every capture the run wrote inside the menu window s00..s18 must score

# before it; the lowest window capture on a clean stamp is 92.0, 2.0 over the bar, and the lowest s18 alone

# between the controller-configuration screens and the mission briefing. It deliberately does not
# count the rest of the run: a boot supplies ten or more black frames of its own before the probe
# has left the memory-card screens, and counting those makes the gate green on a run that never
# reached the briefing at all.
#
# That is not hypothetical -- it is what this gate did between `wcap1` (2026-09-11) and this fix.
# The controller-configuration "save to memory card?" dialog started appearing on boot;
# gameplay_probe.txt guards it with ifref pairs and transition_probe.txt did not, so the probe
# stalled on the dialog. Every run since examined 0 frames at/after its burst step and passed on
# boot black screens alone: wcap1 10 frames / 0 after, wcap2 13 / 0, famb 11 / 0, famc 10 / 0,
# hostdraw_on 11 / 0, hostdraw_fix 9 / 0. Runs from before the dialog did measure the transition
# (gate/first 6 / 5, gate/native_on 4 / 4, runs/gl_transition 8 / 7), which is why the floor of 5
# looked calibrated. All of the stalled runs FAIL under the scorer as it now stands; that is the
# honest record, not a regression.
#
# The same defect came back on 2026-09-12 in its other half. The guards were there, but the burst
# was pinned to step 11 (right after the FIRST guard pair) while the dialog can land on a later
# pair: logs/parity/gate/s4_mb matched it at steps 13/14, so the burst fired on a controller-
# configuration screen and the only frames left of the actual fade were four 1 Hz wait captures --
# FAIL, "4 black-screen frames examined, need 5", three runs running. The burst is now `ifburst`
# (drive.py): one after every guard pair, and only the pair that answered the dialog fires its
# own. score_transition reads the step back off the captures the run wrote (observed_burst_step),
# so the scored frames are the frames after the NO press wherever that press landed. Only bursts at
# a step the script marks `ifburst` count: the probe also ends with an unconditional burst on the
# settled briefing, and a run that answered no dialog but still reached that burst would otherwise
# have it read as "the transition" and pass quietly on it (found in review, 2026-09-12).
#
# transition_probe.txt carries those guards and puts its burst on the NO press, so the fade is
# captured at 5 fps. Calibrated 2026-09-11 on two consecutive clean runs of the fixed probe:
# logs/parity/gate/tfix3 examined 18 frames at/after the burst step and tfix4 17, every frame
# peak 0. Both clear 5 by more than 3x, so the floor stays 5: under it, a run either did not reach
# the fade or lost its captures. black_rows.py exits 0 when it examines nothing, so the exit code
# alone is a vacuous pass and the count is part of the verdict.
# Recalibrated 2026-09-17 (research/34 section 6): with the guest clock on wall time the black screen before
# the briefing lasts about 4 s (s6_clock_gate: 4 wait captures at 1 Hz, all peak 0) where the two-thirds-speed
# clock gave 14 (s6_clutfix_gate). Three keeps the vacuous-pass guard (a stalled run examines 0 or 1).

# Sprint 14 E2 -- the heldout leg (the spec's D6: frozen scene references the agents never see). Twelve step captures
# the three stages already take are frozen once, from a green 3/3 gate stamp, into LEG_REFS_DIR (`--capture-heldout`,
# the controller's, at a quiet window); `--leg heldout <stamp>` then scores a stamp the chain made against them. It
# never launches, never locks, never reads the disk: it reads two directories. The name lives in this file and the
# merged-chain template only -- tools_py/tests' isolation test fails on any other file that mentions it (docs/ aside),
# so no skill, brief or DEVELOPING paragraph can name it.
#
# The stamps: drive.py writes exactly one `s<NN>_<buttons>.png` per step of a stage's script (the settled screen;
# the `s<NN>_burst_<k>.png` frames and the `w<NN>_<k>.png` waits are other files), under <stamp>/<stage>/. The
# buttons part moves with the run (an `ifref` step is `s12_RIGHT` when its dialog showed, `s12_none` when not), so a
# reference is filed by stage and step only: <stage>_s<NN>.png.
#
# The scorer and the bar: the one comparison of a capture against a reference image the gate already makes --
# score_title's, compare.score through _score_value, at TITLE_MIN_SCORE. The other stages' scorers are structural
# (black_rows' band peak, the briefing band, the gameplay band, live pairs) and compare no capture with a reference,
# so there is no other bar to take; and no new threshold is set here (a threshold is a KNOWN row or a test).

 *   pointer lock is unavailable — headless Playwright, a touch screen — dragging still looks, so the
 *   screenshot tests and a tablet both keep working.
 * - **W/S** fly along the look direction, pitch included, so looking down and holding W descends.
 *   **A/D** strafe level with the horizon whatever the pitch: a strafe that dipped with the nose makes
 *   it impossible to sidle along a wall while looking at it.
 * - **Space** up, **Shift** down, both in world space. **Double-tap W and hold** to boost, which widens
 *   the view to match -- Minecraft's own sprint gesture, and the only one that is safe here: Ctrl+W
 *   closes the tab and no page can prevent it, so nothing is bound to Ctrl.
 *   **Q/E** stay bound to down/up as they were, for anyone with the old keys in their fingers.
 * - **Wheel** trims the speed between a tenth and sixteen times, because a map is 100 m across but a
 *   prop is 30 cm.
 *
 * Movement is velocity-based rather than position-based: keys steer a target velocity that the real
 * velocity chases, so starts ramp and stops glide instead of snapping. `setPose` kills the velocity
 * outright, which is what keeps the Playwright poses exact.
 *
 * Yaw and pitch are kept here rather than read back off the camera's quaternion, so the debug hook can

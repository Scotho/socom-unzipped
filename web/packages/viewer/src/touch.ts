 * Moving on a touch screen.

 * A one-finger drag already looks around, which is the half of it the canvas gives for free; what a
 * phone has no way to do is *move*. So the left half of the screen becomes a virtual stick -- a circle
 * that appears wherever the thumb lands and follows it -- and two buttons in the bottom-right corner
 * do what Q and E do. The right half is left alone, so looking still works while the stick is held.
 *
 * Deliberately small. No sprint, no tuning, no gestures: the stick feeds an axis pair into the same
 * velocity model the keys drive (`./camera`), and the ramp and the glide come out of that for free.

 * screen the way a pointer event gives it. What comes back is `x` right and `y` **forward**, so the
 * sign of `dy` flips: pushing the stick up the screen moves the camera the way it is looking.
 *
 * Two shaping rules, both there to stop the stick feeling wrong rather than to be clever:
 *
 * - **Dead zone.** A thumb resting on the glass wanders a few pixels, and without a dead zone the
 *   camera creeps whenever a finger is down. Inside it the answer is exactly zero.
 * - **Rescaled past it.** The magnitude is remapped so that the dead-zone edge is 0 and the rim is 1,
 *   rather than jumping straight to `DEAD_ZONE` the moment the zone is left. Direction is untouched.
 *
 * The magnitude is clamped to 1, so a thumb dragged off the base is fully pushed rather than faster
 * than fully pushed -- `camera.update` clamps too, but a vector that means what it says is easier to
 * reason about than one that relies on being clamped later.

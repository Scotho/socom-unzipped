 * The debug hook `main.ts` hangs on `window` and Playwright drives: an exact camera pose, the numbers the
 * screenshot test asserts on, and the toggle states.
 *
 * It lives in its own file so that there is one declaration of the shape rather than two that can drift:
 * `main.ts` assigns `window.__viewer` and `e2e/viewer.spec.ts` reads it, both against the interface below.
 * The `declare global` is what makes the property exist on `Window` — the alternative was a cast to `any`.

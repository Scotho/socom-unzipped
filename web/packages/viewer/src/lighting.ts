/**
 * How the PS2 lights a multiplayer map, which is mostly that it does not.
 *
 * **The world is drawn unlit.** The EE builds each object's VU1 command list per frame
 * (`FUN_003b5f20`, decomp 307800-308038) and emits the light command (`0x54`/`0x18`, or `0x56`/`0x1a`)
 * only when the node, or the model node it instances, carries `m_dynamic_motion` or `m_dynamic_light`
 * (`FUN_003b6d10`, decomp 308333-308357; `NODE_FLAGS_LIT` in `@s2u/scene`). Frostfire has no such node
 * among its 448 drawn ones; Desert Glory and Crossroads none; a few maps flag a handful of ferns,
 * palms and flares. For everything else command `0x08` copies the material colour (`record2`) into
 * `RGBAQ` untouched, and what reaches the GS is the vertex colour the exporter baked -- the
 * `prelight` the nodes are flagged with -- times the texel.
 *
 * **Then the frame is brightened.** The game's post-process copies the frame at half size and draws it
 * back with `ALPHA = (Cd - 0) * FIX + Cd`, `out = Cd * (1 + FIX / 128)` on every pixel, the fog colour
 * included. `FIX` comes from the auto-exposure thread's readback of a column of frame pixels
 * (`FUN_003b24c0`); the console dump measured 93, a lift of 1.73x (`docs/research/31` sections 12-13).
 * The defaults cap it at 100.
 *
 * That is the "factor of eight" the earlier spec could not place: the viewer lit every vertex with the
 * rig (about 0.21 at a ground normal on Frostfire, so five times too dark) and then applied no
 * brighten (1.73x more). The rig itself is exact -- it reproduces the captured VU1 quadwords bit for
 * bit -- and is still applied where the engine applies it.
 *
 * For a lit part the VU computes (`socom2_dispatch_0x1b50.cpp` command `0x18` -> `0x1440`):
 *
 * ```
 *   lit = C0*max(dot(D0,N),0) + C1*max(dot(D1,N),0) + C2*max(dot(D2,N),0) + ambient
 *   staging + 1 = record2 * lit
 * ```
 *
 * three directional lights and an ambient out of `MP*.ZED/GlobalLighting`, with the three directions
 * in the *columns* of `vf5`-`vf7`. The `params.y`/`params.z` lanes are a per-node scale
 * (`customGlobalLight / 127`, `vis_main.cpp:389-403`) that is 1.0 on every node of the corpus.

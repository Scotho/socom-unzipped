 * Turning `MP*_GEO.ZED`'s prototype forest into placements: what gets drawn where, and which chain in
 * which model buffer draws it.
 *
 * The rule is `hookupVisuals` (`research/recom/src/gamez/zVisual/vis_main.cpp:58-175`). A model's chunk
 * keys are numbered `N` by the model's own visual-bearing nodes, depth first, never descending through
 * an instance; `I` by the model's instance contexts; `V` by the node's visuals. So a chunk does not
 * belong to "the world" as a whole -- it belongs to one node of the world, and takes that node's matrix
 * times every matrix above it.

# 89 — The gunplay's effects: the zAnim effect commands, the casing, the particles, the impacts and the marks (2026-09-28)

The EFFECTS workstream of the walk mode (the owner: "1:1 feel of SOCOM 2"). Everything a round shows around the
rifle: the muzzle effect a weapon record names (`FireAnimName`), the ejected casing, the smoke, the bullet's impact
per surface and its mark. Read-only on the disc (`game/disc/RUN/`, the owner's extraction under `web/redotcom/public/maps/RUN`)
and on the decomp (`game/analysis/socom2_game.elf.decomp.c`, cited as `decomp <line>` with the `FUN_` address);
reCOM (`research/recom/src/gamez/zAnim/zanim.h`) for the structures' names. No game run. The disc bytes stay out of
the tree; `npx tsx tools/dump-effects.ts MP2 <animation> [--mission] [--decoded]` prints what this note reads.

## 0. The answers

- **The command numbers are the registration order** (§1). `FUN_0025bc20` (decomp 106863) registers the zAnim base
  set one command after another; a command's number in the data is its place, from 1: `IF` 2 … `OBJECT_MOTION` 21,
  `OBJECT_MOTION_FROM_TO` 22, `PARTICLE_SOURCE` 27, `SOUND` 30, `LIGHT` 32, `CALL_ANIMATION` 45, `STOP_SEQUENCE` 51;
  `VALVE` (61) comes from a later module. SOCOM 1's numbers (reCOM's `DATATYPE_*`) are not these.
- **The M4A1 SD's round** (§4): `muzzle_m4SD` calls `shell_eject` and `shell_smoke_med` -- no flash. The casing flies
  to the rifle's right and up at 18.6-26.1 units a second, falls at -98, tumbles, bounces on the hull by its
  material's coefficient with its material's sound (`.BUL_CASE_METAL` on metal …), and **vanishes at rest or at 1.2 s**.
  At most four casings at once take the bouncing flight (the `bullet_ejecting` valve); the rest fly 0.7 s through
  everything. In the aim view (`muzzle_m4SD_zoom`) the casing is `shell_eject_first_person`, **hidden** (it still
  bounces and sounds).
- **The smoke is switched off** (§3). `shell_smoke_med` -- the rifles' and pistols' muzzle smoke -- carries a whole
  particle configuration with flag A `0x1` set and `0x2` clear: "set the source's state to off". It never emits.
  The retail game draws no smoke from the M4A1 SD; the viewer draws none either. `shell_smoke_big` (the shotgun's) is on.
- **The M4A1's flash** (§4): `flash_fire_hider` shows the `muzzle_flash_hider` model at the muzzle along the barrel,
  turned about the barrel by one of eight angles, scaled from 0.1 to 0.9-1.3 over 0.05 s, gone a frame later; a
  dynamic light beside it. **No tracer** for the M4A1 SD: tracers are every fourth round of the SMGs, rifles and MGs,
  the suppressed ones excluded (§4).
- **The impacts are the map's** (§5). A bullet's hit plays `<HitAnimName>_<material>` -- `bullet_hit_metal_thick`,
  `bullet_hit_stone` … -- which live in each map's **`MZANIM.ZAR`** (only the glass ones are in `CZANIM`): sparks and a
  flame linger on metal, dust spurts and spinning chunks on stone, dirt and gravel, a splash and a ring on water, each
  with its sound (`.BUL_METAL`, `.BUL_STONE` …). No C code draws an impact.
- **The marks are per material with no default** (§5): the weapon's `DecalSet` row for the polygon's material, none
  when the material has no row (METAL_GRATE, GRAVEL, WATER, MUD, LEAVES …); square to the round, projected along it onto
  the surface, no turn; 150 kept, oldest recycled; no fade. A polygon whose material byte is 0 takes the map's
  `DefaultMaterial` (Frostfire `METAL_THICK`).
- **A mark is as dark as the wall under it** (§13). The game draws a mark with the world vertices' own colours: the GS
  modulates its texel by the wall's baked light. The viewer drew the bitmap bare (texel x 1.0) on walls lit at
  0.1-0.5 of unity, so its marks were light grey smudges, two to eight times lighter than the game's.

## 1. The zAnim command set

**Numbering** (`FUN_0025bc20`, decomp 106863-106924; `FUN_0026a8e0(0x414bb0, name, parser, begin, tick, end)`):

| # | name | begin / tick | # | name | begin / tick |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | QUAD_ALIGN | – / 0x2679e0 | 19 | OBJECT_ROTATE_STATE | – / 0x263730 |
| 2 | IF | – / 0x25e7a0 | 20 | OBJECT_AIM | 0x2634a0 / 0x2633a0 |
| 3 | ELSEIF | – / 0x25e6d0 | 21 | OBJECT_MOTION | 0x262690 / 0x261370 |
| 4 | ELSE | – / 0x25e6d0 | 22 | OBJECT_MOTION_FROM_TO | 0x25fe70 / 0x25f9b0 |
| 5 | ENDIF | – / 0x25e6a0 | 25 | OBJECT_OPACITY_FROM_TO | 0x25f960 / 0x25f880 |
| 9 | RANGE_TEST | – / 0x25de90 | 27 | PARTICLE_SOURCE | – / 0x266830 |
| 10 | RANDOM_WEIGHT | – / 0x25dcf0 | 30 | SOUND | – / 0x2659c0 |
| 11 | FAIL | – / 0x25dce0 | 32 | LIGHT | – / 0x264cb0 |
| 14 | LOOP | – / 0x25ede0 | 43 | EXPRESSION | – |
| 15 | WAIT | 0x25ed50 / 0x25ec50 | 45 | CALL_ANIMATION | 0x25d5c0 / 0x25d550 |
| 17 | OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE | – / 0x263aa0 | 51 | STOP_SEQUENCE | – / 0x25d230 |
| 18 | OBJECT_TRANSLATE_STATE | – / 0x263890 | 61 | VALVE | – / 0x353d00 |

The full list is `ZANIM_COMMAND_NAMES` in `@s2u/scene`'s `effects.ts`. 59-60 are `RESET_BODY_PARTS` and
`BODY_FALL_ON_MATERIAL_SOUND` (`FUN_0059ac60`), 61-63 `VALVE`, `VBIT`, `VWATCH` (`FUN_00354470`, decomp 252347).

**Control flow.**
- `IF`/`ELSEIF` carry a u32 count, then their conditions as whole sub-commands.
- `RANDOM_WEIGHT` holds when `rand()·2⁻³¹ <= p` (the f32 at +4; decomp 107783). The flash's eight turns chain them at
  1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4: each branch one eighth.
- `RANGE_TEST` compares the squared distance between two points against +0x24 (flags 0x40-0x800 pick the
  comparison, 0x100 "farther than"; decomp 107820).
- `VALVE` (tick `FUN_00353fd0`, decomp 252128): a valve reference (+4; flag 2 at +13 makes it a name index), an
  operand (+8) and an operation (+12): 0 true, 1 !=, 2 ==, 3 >, 4 <, 5 >=, 6 <=, 0x0b set, 0x0c add, 0x0d subtract
  (floored at 0), 0x0e multiply.
- `WAIT` (begin `FUN_0025ed50`): seconds in the f32 at +8, or frames with flag 0x10; flag 0x20 adds a random range.
- `LOOP` (`FUN_0025ede0`): back to the sequence's start until a count (flag 1; -1 never) or a time (flag 2).
- `FAIL` returns 0 from its tick, which stops the animation.
- A sequence's word (`_zsequence`): bits 1-7 its activation. 1 runs at the start. 2 is the activation gate
  `Anim_Params`' second offset names (`FUN_002734b0`, decomp 120743): `shell_eject`'s is "if the camera is more than
  100 units from the caller, FAIL", so no casing is thrown out of sight.

**The context** (`FUN_00272bb0`, typed arguments; `FUN_00272720` reads them):
- Type 3 is the caller's node: the commands' node byte 0xFA (-6). 0xF9 (-7) is the animation's own instance (its root
  model, copied per play: `create_instance`, `Anim_Params` flags bit 7).
- Type 5 is a position, 6 a velocity, 7 a direction.
- The round's muzzle animation (`FUN_005c5340`, decomp 479430-479480) gets
  `(3, the weapon's node, 5, firepoint+0x30, 6, the fire direction)`. `firepoint+0x30` is the firepoint's place in the
  weapon: `OBJECT_TRANSLATE_STATE` with flag 2 adds it and carries it through the reference node's matrix
  (`FUN_00310980`), which puts the flash at the muzzle.
- A hit (`FUN_003c8920`, decomp 319339) gets `(5, the hit, 7, the surface normal, 6, the round's velocity)`.

**Node state.**
- `OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE` (+4 u16 1 shows, else hides; node u16 +6).
- `OBJECT_TRANSLATE_STATE` / `OBJECT_ROTATE_STATE`: node +6, reference node +7 (whose world place or rotation the node
  takes), flags +4 (1 set, 2 add, 4 keep), xyz or euler at +8.
- `OBJECT_MOTION_FROM_TO` as the flashes use it (flags 0x300): the time at +0x34, from at +0x38, to at +0x44, the rate
  at +0x50. On all three of `flash_fire_hider`'s the rate is exactly (to − from) / time, which pins the reading.
- `LIGHT`: an RGB in 0..255 at +0x20 and a radius at +0x2c (`zoom_flash_fire`'s muzzle light: 204, 173, 120; 51.2).
- `CALL_ANIMATION`: the name index in the byte at +7.
- `SOUND`: the name index in the u16 at +6 (research 81 §6).

## 2. `OBJECT_MOTION` (21): the thrown node

Begin `FUN_00262690` (decomp 110463), tick `FUN_00261370` (decomp 109820). Offsets from the command's start.

| Off | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| +4 | u32 | flags (below) |
| +8 | u8 | the node moved (0xF9 the instance, 0xFA the caller) |
| +9 | u8 | the launch frame's node; 0 the world |
| +0xa / +0xb | u8 | a sequence / sound name index for a bounce whose material names none |
| +0xc | f32 | the impact speed at full volume (0: always full) |
| +0x10 | f32 | gravity scale, times the main gravity (-98: `Anim_Main_Params`, 77 §9) |
| +0x14 | f32 | the terminal-velocity k (flag 0x2) |
| +0x18 | f32 | times the caller's velocity (type 6, flag 0x800) |
| +0x1d / +0x1e | s8 / s16 | the material table's count and self-relative offset (12 bytes an entry) |
| +0x20 / +0x22 | s16 | block A `[azimuth°, zenith°, speed, accel]`, block B their random ranges |
| +0x60 | f32 | the default bounce coefficient |
| +0x64 | f32 | the ground tolerance, a fraction of the object's height |
| +0x74 / +0x76 / +0x78 / +0x7a | s16 | the tumble block, the angular velocity block, the scale-rate block, an extra random block |
| +0x7c | f32 | lifetime, seconds (flag 0x1) |

Flags: 0x1 lifetime, 0x2 terminal velocity, 0x8 fixed launch, 0x10 random launch, 0x20 impact sound, 0x40 floor probe,
0x80 swept line probe, 0x100 angular velocity, 0x200 roll, 0x400 tumble, 0x800 add the caller's velocity, 0x1000 /
0x2000 the direction from the caller's type 7 / 6.

**The launch.**
- The direction is `FUN_0025cb00` (decomp 107097): `(−sin az·(1−|e|), e, −cos az·(1−|e|))` with `e = zenith/90`,
  **not normalised**.
- The velocity is that direction times the speed, rotated into the frame node's world matrix, plus the caller's
  velocity times +0x18.
- A material entry is a u32 code, then the reference speed at +4 and the bounce coefficient at +8. The code: bit 0
  uses the reference speed, bit 1 the bounce coefficient; bits 2-9 the material, bits 10-17 the sound's name index,
  bits 18-25 a sequence's. The first match wins.

**The tick.**
- The step is explicit Euler: the position moves `v·dt`, then `v += a·dt`. While falling with flag 0x2, `v.y`'s step
  is scaled by the terminal table `1 − (e^(x) − 1)/(e^10 − 1)`, `x = 0.25·clamp(int(40·v.y·k), 0, 40)`.
- The line probe (flag 0x80, used rising or moving mostly sideways) reflects `v` about the normal and scales it by the
  coefficient `e`.
- The floor probe (0x40, falling) reflects `v` and scales it by `1 − (1 − e)|v̂·n|`, then sets `a.y` back to gravity.
- Each bounce plays the entry's sound (flag 0x20) at volume `min(1, speed/ref)`, full when the reference is 0.
- The command is done when the lifetime runs out, when a bounce leaves the speed under `0.08·|a|` (7.84 at -98), or
  when the object is found below the floor.
- Tumble (0x400): the euler angles (from 0: the rotation the sequence copied from the caller is overwritten) gain
  `dt·rate·(n̂z, 0, −n̂x)`, and the rate gains its acceleration.

**`shell_eject`** (both flights; `effects.test.ts` pins them):

| | the full flight (flags 0x0cf3) | the cheap flight (flags 0x0c13) |
|---|---|---|
| launch | az 170-190°, zenith 30°, speed 25-35 in the caller's frame | the same |
| gravity | 1 × -98 | the same |
| terminal k | -1/980 | the same |
| bounce | 0.30 default; the table below | none: no probes |
| lifetime | 1.2 s | 0.7 s |
| tumble | 30°/s, -5°/s² | the same |

The full flight's material table:

| material | sound | coefficient |
|---|---|---|
| 25-26 metal | `.BUL_CASE_METAL` | 0.35 |
| 7 stone, 22 asphalt | `.BUL_CAS_STONE` | 0.25 |
| 4 grass | `.BUL_CAS_DIRT` | 0.10 |
| 8 dirt | `.BUL_CAS_DIRT` | 0.15 |
| 5 sand | `.BUL_CAS_SAND` | 0.15 |
| 19-20 wood | `.BUL_CAS_WOOD` | 0.27 |

Its sequence: `bullet_ejecting += 1`; show the instance; place and turn it at the caller; if `bullet_ejecting < 5`
the full flight, else the cheap one; `bullet_ejecting -= 1`; hide the instance. So the casing is gone the moment it
stops. The casing model is `EFFE_GEO`'s `bullet_shell_9m`, 0.45 units long (4.5 cm at ten units to the metre),
`shell_gold.tif`. `shell_eject_first_person` (the aim view's) launches at zenith 50° ±20° at 15-20 a second for
0.75 s, and shows nothing: its `OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE` is 0 at both ends.

## 3. `PARTICLE_SOURCE` (27): the emitters

Tick `FUN_00266830` (decomp 112759); the manager: `FUN_00329b40` emission (226782), `FUN_00327cd0` spawn,
`FUN_003282b0` step, `FUN_003251b0` sprite draw (223925), `FUN_00326350` streak draw (224624). Every field is an
override applied when its bit of flags A (+4) is set; the source's defaults are `FUN_0032ab20`'s (227362).

**Fields.**

| Off | Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| +0x0c | – | the source's name index (one source per animation and name, `FUN_0026ea20`) |
| +0x0d | A 0x10 / 0x20 | its node (0xFA the caller); 0x10 follows the node, 0x20 adds its origin |
| +0x0e | A 0x10000 | particles per emission event |
| +0x10-0x12 | – | the counts of textures, colour keys, scale keys |
| +0x13 | – | type (low nibble): 0 sprite, 1 rotated, 2 xz, 3 streaked, 4 unchanged |
| +0x14 | A 0x4 | position offset |
| +0x20 | A 0x40 / B | the base velocity in the node's frame; or its f32 scales a context vector (B 0x2 the normal; B 0x40 the velocity; B 0x100 that reflected about the normal; B 0x400 the velocity made a unit) |
| +0x2c | A 0x80 / B | a world velocity, the same with B 0x4 / 0x80 / 0x200 / 0x800 |
| +0x38-0x4c | A 0x100-0x400 | the random velocity box per axis (world; local with B 0x80000) |
| +0x50-0x64 | A 0x800-0x2000 | the random spawn box per axis |
| +0x80 | A 0x8000 / 0x4000 | the emission interval, per second / per unit moved |
| +0x84 | A 0x20000 | acceleration |
| +0x90 | A 0x40000 | friction k |
| +0x9c / +0xa4 / +0xac | A 0x100000 / 0x200000 / 0x400000 | the size (a half-width, units), the starting age, the lifetime (s): min, max |
| +0xb4 / +0xbc | A 0x800000 / 0x1000000 | the near and far fades (distances; compared squared) |
| +0xc4 | B 0x8 | offset of a random position block (base xyz, range xyz) |
| +0xc6 | B 0x1 | the emission events allowed (-1 unlimited) |
| +0xc8 | A 0x4000000 / 0x8000000 | offset of the texture list (`u16` name, f32 t): one at random, or stepped through the life |
| +0xca | A 0x10000000 | offset of the colour keys (t, r, g, b, a) |
| +0xcc | A 0x20000000 | offset of the scale keys (t, multiplier) |
| +0xd0 | type 3 | offset of the streak's two numbers (default 1.0, 0.3) |

Flag A 0x1 sets the source active to A 0x2 (`FUN_00329ac0`); A 0x8 places it at the context's position (type 5).

**Running.**
- The first tick after activation records the source's place and emits nothing.
- Then an accumulator counts events (`int(acc × rate)`), each of `perEvent` particles spread over the frame, until
  the events allowed are spent or the animation ends.
- A particle's size, lifetime and starting age are drawn from their ranges. Its velocity is `Node·base + world +
  U(box)`.
- Each tick: `pos += v·dt`, then `v += a·dt`, then the friction `v = w + (v − w)/P(k·dt)`, where
  `P(x) = 1 + x/2 + x²/3 + … + x⁶`, halved and squared back (about `e^(−k dt/2)`); `w` is the wind, 0 here. It dies at
  its lifetime.

**Drawing.**
- A particle is a GS **sprite**: a screen-aligned square `2·size·scale(t)` across (PRIM 0x0F6, decomp 224013).
- Its colour keys times 128 are the vertex colour, so `MODULATE` leaves the texel at 1.0 and the alpha may go over 1.
  With no keys it is white with alpha `1 − t`.
- The alpha is times the camera fade, linear in d² across the far pair. The particles draw back to front, depth-tested
  with no depth write.
- The blend is the texture's own bind packet: `cloudpuff01.tif` and `effect_dustpuff01.tif` source alpha,
  `effect_spark01.tif`, `explosion2.tif` and `effect_muzzle01.tif` additive.
- A streaked particle (type 3) is a band from where it was a tick ago to where it is. The head is pushed `size` on,
  the tail `size × streak[0]` back, and the tail's alpha is times `streak[1]`. The metal sparks' streak is 10 and 0.7.

**`shell_smoke_med`**: `IF RANDOM_WEIGHT(0.5)`, then source `blue_smoke01` with flags A `0x37ffbfd1`, then `WAIT
0.25`. Bit 1 set with bit 2 clear switches it off (decomp 112833-112838). The configuration it would have run is two
puffs of `cloudpuff01.tif`: 60 units a second along the caller's +x, 0.5-1 s, grey-blue 0.4/0.4/0.5, a half-width of
2-3 growing ×20, out to a 40-60 unit cloud. It looks abandoned. `shell_smoke_big` (the shotgun's `muzzle_shotgun`) is
the same role switched on: `effect_dustpuff01.tif` every 0.03 s for 0.2 s, 1 s each, rising at 20.

## 4. The muzzle and the tracer

**The muzzle effect.** `FUN_005c5340` (decomp 479059, gated on `DAT_003e1538`) plays the weapon's `FireAnimName` per
round, or `<name>_zoom` when the view mode `char+0x200` is above 0 (the aim view; the names are built by
`FUN_003c4700` with `%s_zoom`, and a turret's `%s_zoom_TT`). The M4A1 family:

| animation | calls |
|---|---|
| `muzzle_m4SD` | `shell_eject`, `shell_smoke_med` |
| `muzzle_m4SD_zoom` | `zoom_fire_silent` (= `shell_eject_first_person`), `shell_smoke_med` |
| `muzzle_m4` | `shell_eject`, `flash_fire_hider`, `shell_smoke_med` |
| `muzzle_m4_zoom` | `zoom_flash_fire` (a `LIGHT`), `shell_smoke_med` |

**`flash_fire_hider`** runs four sequences side by side:
- `fire_fix` holds the instance at the caller, turned as the weapon and shown, once a tick (a `LOOP` forever).
- `fire_rotate` turns the `rotate` node about the barrel by ±45°, ±22.5°, 77.5° or 0 (the chained random weights).
- `fire_scale` scales the `scale` node from 0.1 to 1.2, 0.9 or 1.3 (weights 0.33, 0.5, the rest) over 0.05 s, waits
  one frame, stops `fire_fix` and hides the instance.
- `light_at_muzzle` lights the muzzle.

The model, `EFFE_GEO`'s `muzzle_flash_hider`, is five `effect_muzzle01.tif` quads (additive), 6.16 units along +x: an
end-on star and four fins.

**The tracer.**
- The tracer weapons are the SMGs (ids 31-50), assault rifles (51-80), MGs (91-100), heavy (141-144) and turrets
  (205-229) (`FUN_003cb1a0`, decomp 320657).
- The suppressed ids 16, 33, **62 (M4A1 SD)**, 67 and 105 are excluded (`FUN_003c5ac0`, 317147).
- Of the tracer weapons, a round draws one when the shooter's round count is a multiple of 4 (`FUN_003cabe0`, 320545).
- The tracer flies from the muzzle to the hit, accelerating: 400/s², pool 100 (`FUN_003d5030`, 327160).

## 5. The impacts and the marks

**The hit path.**
- `FUN_003c9b70` (decomp 319920) walks a round's hits nearest first. It skips the shooter's own nodes and the materials
  whose `PENETRATION` is 1.0 (ACTION, INVISIBLE_DI, ITEM, the `*_VOL`s), whose hits pass without effect or mark.
- `FUN_003c8920` takes each remaining hit:
  - beyond the remaining range the round stops;
  - the node's damage callback runs;
  - **the mark** (`FUN_003d0ba0`, decomp 323789);
  - an AI noise;
  - **the impact**: the weapon's hit animation for the material, played at the hit with the normal and the round's
    velocity (gated on `DAT_003e1540`, 1 on the disc);
  - the penetration: the range shrinks by the material's `PENETRATION`, and a round through glass goes on to the wall
    behind.
- `RICOCHET` is read and never used; nothing on the disc makes a ricochet.

**The names** (`FUN_003c4700`, decomp 316255): `sprintf("%s_%s", HitAnimName, material)` for every material, looked
up without regard to case in every animation set (`FUN_0026a250`). Every gun's `HitAnimName` is `bullet_hit`
(`zweapon.rdr`), so the M4A1 SD's hits are the map's `bullet_hit_<material>`.

**The mark.**
- The weapon's `DecalSet` (`BULLET_MARK_SMALL`) row for the raw material index; a row without a texture is no mark.
  There is **no default**.
- The size is `min + rand·(max − min)` units across.
- The square is square to the round's direction, its up the world axis least aligned with the normal
  (`FUN_00307810`, decomp 206429): **no random turn**. It is projected along the round onto the surface and clipped
  to the triangles facing the round.
- It goes to the temporary pool: `TEMP_DECAL_POOL` base 150, overflow 50, trimmed back to 150 oldest-first each frame
  (`FUN_003bf110`). A set flagged `PERMENANT` (the grenade's blast) goes to the permanent one. No timed fade was found.
- The permanent pool is `PERM_DECAL_POOL` base 30, overflow 0 (`decals.rdr`; read into `0x4b5050`, decomp
  324141-324148). `FUN_003b3800` takes one entry per kept world triangle (306401-306417); `FUN_003bf1a0` refuses once
  the count reaches base + overflow (313254-313262); `FUN_003bf110` trims the temporary pool only (218207, 219048,
  236776) and `FUN_003bf050` empties both at the level's teardown (218219, 219060). So a map keeps its first 30 scorch
  triangles, the one that only partly fits partly drawn, and refuses the rest; nothing is recycled
  (`PERM_DECAL_TRIANGLES`, `viewer/test/grenadeScorchPool.test.ts`). [Reading, the viewer's: a scorch with nothing
  drawn under it yet stands in as the bare square and charges the pool its **2** entries (`grenade.ts`
  `squareEntries`) until the late clip (`clipLate`) swaps them for the clipped count; the game would take no entry for
  a mark over no triangle. The candidates' order in the clip is the viewer's walk, not the game's list.]
- Its colour is the colour of the world vertices it is clipped to, per vertex (§13).

**The material table** (SOILS index = the polygon's `material` byte, research 81 §4; 0 takes the map's
`DefaultMaterial` from `READERM.ZAR/<map>.rdr`'s `world_params` -- `FUN_002dc1d0` reads `DAT_0044f310`,
`FUN_002ddc30` sets it at the load, decomp 152110):

The metal, stone, dirt and grass impacts carry a leading `lensfx == 5` gate (the NVG view) for an `NVGPUFF` sprite.
The flash they open with (`fire_flash`: `firepuff`, `explosion2.tif`) is additive.

## 6. In the viewer

- **`@s2u/scene`**:
  - `effects.ts`: the numbering, `decodeEffectProgram` (every command of an animation to an `EffectOp`),
    `decalSetRows`, `tracerRound`;
  - `effectMotion.ts`: `decodeObjectMotion`, `launchMotion`, `stepMotion`, the terminal table;
  - `effectParticles.ts`: `decodeParticleSource`, the keys, the fade, the friction, the context velocities;
  - `effectModels.ts`: the `EFFE_GEO`/`EFFE_MDL` models, each chunk in the position form whose vertices fill its
    node's box -- the casings in the weapons' `0x70` form, the flat quads in the world's `0x68` form;
  - `zanim.ts`: each command now carries its bytes.
- **The viewer**:
  - `effectData.ts` (the worker): both zAnim archives' programs, the effect models, the `EFFE`/`ALPH` textures with
    their GS state, the SOILS names, the `DefaultMaterial`, the `BULLET_MARK_SMALL` rows, the `HitAnimName`s;
  - `effectRunner.ts`: the sequencer (§1's control flow);
  - `effects.ts`: `Effects` -- `onRound`, `play(name, place)`, `marks()`, the casings' flight on the walk's hull;
  - `particles.ts`: the particle manager;
  - `effectMaterials.ts`: the GS arithmetic, `(texel × vertex) clamped × (1 + FIX/128)`, blended by the texture's
    packet.
  - `fire.ts` takes the per-material marks (`setMarks`: the row, the projected square, 150 kept) and the tracer rule
    (`setTracerRule`: none for the M4A1 SD). `main.ts` wires `Fire.subscribe` to `effects.onRound`.
- **The grenades' door**: `effects.play(name, { node?, position?, velocity?, normal? })` runs any animation of the
  map's zAnim archives -- `frag_grenade_stone`, `he_grenade`, `grenade_hit_snow`, `dust_explode_med` -- and answers
  false for a name the map lacks. `impactAnimation(hitAnim, material)` builds the per-material name, and
  `effects.materialName(byte)` resolves a polygon's byte (0 → `DefaultMaterial`).
- **Readings and placeholders**:
  - `MARK_GRAZE_FLOOR` (0.2) bounds a slanting mark's stretch where the game clips to the polygon.
  - The casing's floor probe is the walk's segment test straight down, standing in for `FUN_002a2eb0`'s terrain query.
  - `LIGHT` is drawn as the engine's second pass over the lit world (§10); the body is not re-drawn.
  - The zoom mode is read as the first-person view.
  - The rotated (1) and flat (2) particle types are drawn as the engine draws them (§11).
  - The tracer, where one is due, is still `Fire`'s one-frame line, not the travelling `tracer_ally` model.

## 7. Verification

- `scene/test/effects.test.ts`: the numbering; the small commands from their bytes; the launch direction, the terminal
  table, a casing's flight and bounces on a synthetic floor; the keys, fades, friction and context velocities; the
  tracer rule. On Frostfire's archives: the M4A1 family's calls, `shell_eject`'s every number and table,
  `shell_smoke_med` switched off, the metal sparks' streak.
- `scene/test/effectModels.test.ts`: the form choice (a collapsed point fills nothing), the casing 0.45 long, the
  flash hider's five quads.
- `viewer/test/effectRunner.test.ts`: branches, nesting, waits, loops, timed commands, `FAIL`.
- `viewer/test/effects.test.ts`: on the game's data end to end. A round's casing goes right and up, bounces on a
  metal deck with `.BUL_CASE_METAL` and is gone by 1.2 s. The smoke emits nothing. The flash is at the muzzle along
  the barrel and hides. `bullet_hit_metal_thick` and `BULLET_HIT_STONE` (any case) emit with their sounds.
- `viewer/test/fire.test.ts`: the pool of 150.
- `e2e/effects.spec.ts` (Playwright, `?redotcom`, walk mode):
  - Frostfire at spawn A: a casing in the air, a burst's casings bouncing and gone, the sparks and the metal marks on
    the container (`test-fixtures/screens/effects/frostfire-*.png`).
  - Desert Glory at spawn A: the stone wall's dust, sparks and grey marks against the sand's puff and mark, and the
    M4A1's flash held for its picture (`desert-glory-*.png`).

## 8. Open

- The tracer's travelling model and its `redpuffs` particles.
- Whether a mark's or a footprint's 100.0 lifetime is ever counted down.
- The body (skinned) under a light's pass; the lit visuals' own gate (visual flags 0x4000 and 0x10).
- A `WHILE` with conditions (only the endless form is on the effects' path).
- Closed since: the round's own path. `Fire` walks it with `round.ts` `roundPath` (research 84 section 13, the walk the
  match server re-runs): the `PENETRATION` 1.0 materials passed over, a second surface struck when the piercing beats
  the first.

## 9. The grenades' explosions and bounces (round two)

- **The explosion** runs the material's variant, `frag_grenade_<material>`: its own 0.05 s puff, then a call to
  `frag_grenade`. That fires the parts: `FRAG_sparks` (a bare root node thrown by a fixed launch with streaked sparks
  hung on it), `dust_explode_long`, `light_flash_large` (§10), `bsmoke_explode_large`, `dust_ground_roll` and
  `.GREN_MED`. The HE runs `HE_grenade`.
- The grenade's page (`grenade.ts`) emits `explode` and `bounce`. `main.ts` plays their `anim` through `effects.play`
  with a node at the point; the `EXPLOSION_READING` sprites stay only for a map without effect data.
- **`OBJECT_MOTION`'s fixed launch** (flag 0x8, decomp 110654-110911) is block A's speed and pull along the stored
  direction at +0x54. That direction is `FUN_0025cb00` of the block's angles: `FRAG_sparks`' (0, 0.556, -0.444) is
  azimuth 0, zenith 50, pulled at -200 against it.
- An animation rooted at no model still has an instance node (`NODE_ROOT`), which the viewer makes empty. A particle
  source with flag A 0x10 follows its node every tick.

## 10. The lights (`LIGHT`, 32; tick `FUN_00264cb0`, decomp 111906-112214)

**The fields.**

| Off | Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| +4 | – | flags (u16) |
| +6 | – | the light's node |
| +8 | 0x2 | the node it sits at (0xFA the caller) |
| – | 0x8 | at the context's position |
| +9 | 0x100 | the GS ALPHA selector (default 0x44) |
| +0xc / +0x10 | 0x10 | a static min/max range |
| +0x14 | 0x4 | an offset |
| +0x20 | 0x40 | RGB, 0..255 |
| +0x2c | 0x80 | the pass's opacity, over 128 (default 64); **not a radius** |
| +0x34 / +0x36 | 0x20 | the count and offset of `(t, min, max)` keys, linear, the last held |
| +0x3c | – | the command's length |
| – | 0x400 | on the world's light list |

**The lights on the disc.**

| Light | Colour | Blend | Ranges |
|---|---|---|---|
| `light_flash_large` (frag) | 214, 242, 217 | 0x48, additive | 100/190 shrinking to nothing at 0.5 s |
| `HE_light_flash_large` | 230, 217, 166 | additive | to nothing at 0.7 s |
| `zoom_flash_fire` (a muzzle, at the caller) | 204, 173, 120 | 0x44 | 5/12 -> 15/60 -> 0 in 0.1 s |
| `flash_fire_hider`'s `light_at_muzzle` | the same | 0x44 | 6/26 -> 50/100 |

The M4A1 SD's own muzzle has none.

**How the engine draws a light.** It does not light the vertex colours. It draws a **second pass of every lit
visual in reach**, world, characters and weapons alike:
- `FUN_00339660` gives a node the lights whose sphere meets its own, at most six. `FUN_003b5b90` emits VU1 command
  0x3a once a light.
- The handler at 0x23d8 re-draws the triangles with `light_map.tif` (`EFFE_TXR`: white, alpha 0.94 at the centre
  to 0 at the rim) projected on the surface.
- `L = light - P`, `h = max(L.N, 0)`, `f = 0.5 clamp((max - h)/(max - min))`, `gate = min(h, 1)`, and
  `uv = 0.5 + (L.T, L.B)/max`: a spot `max/2` in radius under the light.
- The colour is `min(1, 2 rgb/255 f)` and the alpha `At opacity f gate / 128`. The blend is the light's:
  `dst += Cs As` for the explosions.
- None of the grenade or muzzle animations uses `BLUR3D`, `IRIS_EFFECT` or `TRUE_COLOR_SCALE`. The flashbang's
  blinding is code (`FUN_00597c00`).

**The viewer** (`effectLights.ts`) draws the pass as overlays sharing the world's, the held weapon's and the SEAL's
geometry (the body on its own skeleton), per fragment, with the face's normal. The overlays are pooled (§12).

## 11. Particle types, water, footprints, sounds, the pre-warm

**Particle types.**
- **Rotated** (type 1, `FUN_00325580`): a screen square turned by its angle, its half-diagonal the size.
  - Its corner i is at `C + size (cos(t + i pi/2) right + sin(t + i pi/2) down)`.
  - The angle is spun by the source's spin block (+0xce: spin and acceleration min/max). The spin is stopped where it
    would change sign.
  - The starting angle is the pool slot's stale one, random here.
  - The fire, smoke and explosion dust, and the dirt, stone and wood impacts, are this type.
- **Flat** (type 2, `FUN_00325cc0`): a square in the world XZ plane at the particle's height, `2 size` across, u along
  +z. The ripples, the splash's rings and `bullet_hit_water`'s ring are this type.
- **`WHILE`/`END_WHILE`** (39/40): the ripples loop forever until the engine stops them.

**Water** (`FUN_005b52b0`, decomp 469808-469920). The SEAL's ground probe calls it over LIQUID water:
- With the water line across the body, `big_ripple_anim[_walk|_run]` plays by speed class (`|v|^2` at 0.25 and 400).
  With it up to 10 over the top, `small_ripple_anim*`.
- The ripples play on a node moved each frame to the water under the SEAL.
- The first frame in the water in the air plays `seal_fall_in_water` at the water point: the traversal's `waterLand`.
- Walking into water splashes nothing.
- A round on water is `bullet_hit_water` (its flat `theripple`), nothing special.
- The viewer stops the ripples when the SEAL leaves the water. The game's loops ran on where they were: its call
  comes only over water.

**Footfalls.**
- `FUN_005a49f0` looks up `seal_footfall_<MATERIAL>` for every material. **None exists on any map**, so a footfall
  plays no effect.
- `FUN_005a3280` (decomp 460186) prints `decals.rdr`'s `FOOTSTEP_DECALS` (SAND `stamp_footprint01.tif`, SNOW
  `stamp_footprint_snow.tif`) at each footfall, not prone. It is 3.5 across, flat along the ground's normal, and runs
  along the SEAL's forward, in the temporary pool.

**Sounds.** The game resolves a sound by its name's CRC among the loaded banks' sounds: a binary search over one sorted
table (`FUN_00344f30` -> `FUN_00344bf0`), with no fallback bank and no alias. So two effect sounds are silent on the
console. The viewer departs from it deliberately (`SOUND_NAME_FIXES`, `SOUND_FALLBACKS`, `soundFor` in
`@s2u/sound`'s `catalog.ts`, for every path: §12):
- The casings' metal bounce is named `.BUL_CASE_METAL` in `shell_eject`, `shell_eject_60` and
  `shell_eject_first_person`. No bank and no `sounds.rdr` entry carries it, while `.BUL_CAS_METAL` sits in 16 banks,
  Frostfire's among them. The viewer plays the latter.
- Grass and dirt casings ask for `.BUL_CAS_DIRT`, which Blood Lake's banks lack beside their own `.BUL_CAS_GRASS`.
  The viewer plays the first of `.BUL_CAS_GROUND`, `.BUL_CAS_GRASS`, `.BUL_CAS_SAND` the map holds.
- Night Stalker's `.BUL_STONE` is in `MP7_am` and plays: 4 of 4 stone hits heard at spawn A.

**The pre-warm** (research 90 item 16). When the map's effect data arrives, every effect's program is compiled and
its bitmaps uploaded (`Effects.warmUp`, `renderer.compileAsync`): the models, a particle group per texture, the marks'
and footprints' materials, and the light pass's two programs (its colour and opacity are uniforms). A software-rendered
headless browser measured the first frag's first frame at 127 ms warmed against 400 ms cold on Desert Glory. The
blast's overdraw, not its first use, is the rest there.

## 12. Round three: the smoke screen, the characters lit, the ambient effects, the light pool, the casing names

**The smoke grenade.** `smoke_grenade` runs `smoke_stream` on the canister's node: two sources, 2.5 puffs a second
each, a puff living 5-7 s and growing about tenfold, for 20 s of emission. Played through `effects.play` with the
grenade's node (`grenadePlace`), it stands as a grey wall: dense at 6 and 12 s, thinning from about 22 s
(`e2e/effects.spec.ts`: `desert-glory-smoke-screen.png`, `desert-glory-smoke-inside.png`). The game's Timer2 is 40 s.
Whether that re-runs the zAnim was not traced. The grenade workstream's `SMOKE_ALWAYS_PLACEHOLDER` can go.

**The characters take the lights.** The receivers are the world, the held weapon and the SEAL's body. A skinned mesh
is re-drawn as a `SkinnedMesh` bound to the body's own skeleton, beside it, so the pass bends with the pose. The body
has no bounds that follow the pose, so every light reaches it.

**The `_zoom` muzzles.** Every `muzzle_*_zoom` (the turrets, the LAW and the M203 aside) calls only
`shell_smoke_med`, `zoom_fire_silent` or `zoom_flash_fire`. The aim view shows no flash model: it shows a light
(`zoom_flash_fire`, 0x44) and a hidden casing. The M4A1's zoomed round starts one light and shows nothing
(`test/effects.test.ts`).

**Commands 46, 47, 50.**
- `STOP_ANIMATION` (46) and `PAUSE_ANIMATION` (47) name an animation at +4, a name index. Index 0 (`NA`) is the
  running animation itself.
- A paused animation stays alive: its sources keep emitting and its nodes stay. The torches' `loop_torch*` pause
  themselves once lit.
- `CALL_SEQUENCE` (50) restarts the animation's own sequence named at +4.
- **The activation rule** [reading]: a sequence of activation 2 waits when its own animation's `CALL_SEQUENCE` names
  it. Frostfire's `firey_flames` switches its vent lights on and off that way. A sequence of activation 2 that no
  call names runs from the start, as the activation gate does (`shell_eject`'s range test).

**The ambient effects.**
- The mission's ambient effects are the `MZANIM` animations that start themselves (`params.flags & 3 == 1`) and
  draw something: a particle source or a light, directly or through a call.
- They start with the map (`EffectData.ambient`). Their nodes are the scene graph's (`<ARCHIVE>_GEO.ZED`,
  `flattenScene`: `EffectData.sceneNodes`). The node `camera` is the camera: the snow and the rain fall around it.
- Their looping (`~`) sounds are left to the audio's emitters.
- The textures come from the effect libraries, the map's own, `CLIB` and `FLIB`: the snow and the butterflies live in
  the map's.
- A source that follows its node keeps its offset and its box in the node's local space.
- Seen: Frostfire's tower flames (`firey_flames` at `r_tower_flames`: `frostfire-tower-flames.png`), Blizzard's snow,
  Shadow Falls' 30 (torches, bugs, drips) and The Ruins' 9 (rain; the streaks are faint by the data).

**The light pool** (research 90 item 19: a 500-850 ms frame about 0.6 s after every blast, on every map).
- **The cause, measured.** Every `LIGHT` made a new material and an overlay for every receiver mesh in reach (about
  170 on Frostfire), and the light's end disposed them. The frame that first drew them built their programs in the
  frame. Headless Chromium (ANGLE D3D11, WebGL2) measured a 285-300 ms `render` on every blast, not only the first.
- **Now.** Six fixed light slots of shared-group uniforms feed two materials a map: the additive pass (0x48) and the
  lerped one (0x44).
  - Each pass sums its blend's slots in one draw. The additive pass is `C = Σ Cs As`, `A = min(Σ As, 1)`.
  - The lerped pass folds its slots in turn: `C = C (1 − As) + Cs As`, `keep = keep (1 − As)`, `A = 1 − keep`.
  - Both output `C / A` at alpha `A` under `SrcAlpha`, so one light is the single pass of §10 exactly.
- **Overlays.** A receiver mesh gets its two overlays once and keeps them. A light only sets its slot's uniforms and
  shows the overlays in its reach.
- **The pre-warm.** The map's effects pre-warm rides the world's own warm-up after the props are in
  (`ViewerRenderer.warm`: the PS2 frame's target, stand-ins for the hidden meshes). It makes the overlays and shows
  them for the compile call's synchronous projection.
- **Taken out of the scene at once.** The overlays and the warm-up group then leave the scene: a frame drawn while
  the programs built would otherwise build them itself, synchronously. On Desert Glory that was a 2.2 s frame, because
  three keys an instanced mesh's program by its uuid (about 45 receivers there).
- **Measured after** (a headless blast probe, 4 blasts a map, and `tools/playtest.ts`'s grenade scenario): no frame
  over 45 ms at any blast on Frostfire, Desert Glory or Sujo. Desert Glory's six ambient lights were live throughout.
  The load then shows no frame over 125 ms after the reveal on Desert Glory and Frostfire.

**The casing names everywhere** (research 90 item 18).
- The audio's list of wanted names took `shell_eject`'s names raw, so `.BUL_CASE_METAL` was asked for and reported
  missing on every map.
- One table (`@s2u/sound`'s `catalog.ts`: `SOUND_NAME_FIXES`, `SOUND_FALLBACKS`, `soundFor`) now serves the effects'
  plays, the audio's callback plays and the wanted list:
  `.BUL_CASE_METAL` is `.BUL_CAS_METAL`.
- `.SG_SHELL_TIN` is in MP8's and MP61's banks only. On Frostfire the borrowing's six-bank limit does not reach it, so
  it stands in as the map's `.SG_SHELL_METAL`.
- `.SG_SHELL_SAND` (MP6, MP7, MP73) stands in as `.BUL_CAS_SAND`, else `.SG_SHELL_STONE`, which every `_am` bank
  holds.
- A name whose stand-in the map holds is not reported missing. Frostfire, Desert Glory and every map in the audio
  sweep now miss none.

## 13. Round four: the marks' colour (the owner's 2026-09-29 report)

The owner, after playing: the bullet marks show up much lighter and fainter than in the game.

**The cause: the viewer drew a mark's bitmap bare; the game modulates it by the wall's vertex colour.**
- `FUN_003d0ba0` (decomp 323789) hands the hit node to `FUN_003139e0` (213891). It walks every visual of the node
  flagged `0x10000` and clips the mark to each through `FUN_003b3950` → `FUN_003b3ab0` (306470).
- For each world triangle facing the round, `FUN_003b3ab0` keeps its three vertices only if each projects within
  **4.8 units** of the mark's plane (`fabs(z) <= 4.8`). With each vertex it stores a pointer to the world vertex's own
  32-bit colour: the vertex walk's `+0x3c` (`FUN_003ba9a0`, 310593: the colour array plus the index times 4).
- `FUN_003b3800` (306384) takes a pool entry and `FUN_003beca0` (313065) writes the mark's VIF packet. `STCYCL 1,3`,
  then `UNPACK V4-8` (`0x6e038006 | 0x4000`) of the three colour words: RGBA bytes, 0x80 unity. Then the `GIFtag`
  (`PRIM` triangle, `TME`, `FGE`, `ABE` from the texture's flag; `REGS` ST, RGBAQ, XYZF2), the positions and uvs, the
  normal (`V3-16`, `0x6901800e`), and `MSCNT`: the visual's own VU program finishes the draw.
- So `RGBAQ` for every mark vertex is the wall vertex's baked colour, lit as the wall is lit. The GS modulates:
  `C = (Ct x Cv) >> 7`, alpha the same product, blended source alpha over (the `bullet_mark_*.tif` bind packets).
- The same packet draws a footprint (`FUN_005a3280` calls `FUN_003139e0`, decomp 460209) and the grenade's scorch
  (`FUN_003d0ba0`, the permanent pool).

**What was right.**
- The texture's alpha: `@s2u/gs` rescales 0..0x80 to 0..255 (`PS2_ALPHA_FULL`). `bullet_mark_stone.tif`'s alpha
  peaks at 0x52 (163/255): 0.64, as the GS reads it.
- The blend: source alpha on all six `bullet_mark_*.tif`, read off their bind packets.
- The depth offset, the fog (`FGE` is set), the frame's brighten (1.0 in multiplayer). No fade: none in the game.

**What was wrong, with numbers.**
- `markMaterial` drew `texel.rgb x brighten`: no vertex colour. The bitmaps are light grey: stone mean RGB 160, metal
  183, sand 119, wood 208/197/181.
- World vertex colours are well under unity, mean luminance per vertex:
  - Frostfire 0.29, Desert Glory 0.25 (no world vertex is above 128 on any map, `@s2u/mesh`);
  - measured under the marks: Frostfire's container 0x41 (0.508), Desert Glory's stone wall at spawn A 0x10 (0.126),
    Bitter Jungle's dirt 0.25 and its wooden stairs 0.29-0.32, Vigilance's cobbles and rock walls 0.13-0.53.
- A stone mark on Desert Glory's wall drew at grey 160 where the game draws 160 x 0.126 = 20: eight times lighter. On
  Frostfire's container, twice. Every surface was wrong the same way.

**The fix (one rule, every surface).**
- `effectMaterials.markMaterial` is the effects' GS graph, `clamp(texel x vertex colour) x brighten`, alpha the same
  product.
- Each mark and footprint carries its own four-corner `color` attribute (`fire.markGeometry`, `paintMark`).
- `surfaceShade.ts` fills it from the drawn world, which holds the game's colour in each draw's `color` attribute
  (`applyLighting`). A probe runs along the surface normal, `MARK_DEPTH` (4.8, the game's clip depth) either side of
  the hit, over the visible draws. It takes:
  - the drawn surface nearest the hit, skipping the blended draws where a solid one is met;
  - of its coplanar layers, the most opaque. On Vigilance, `ground_grassy.tif` fades out by vertex alpha over
    `cobble_road.tif`; the game puts a copy of the mark on each visual, so the one that shows is the opaque layer's.
  - its triangle's colours, interpolated at the hit.
- `Fire.setShade` and `Effects.setShade` take it (`main.ts`, per map).
- A mark that lands before its wall is drawn (the props stream in after the map shows) is asked again each frame,
  four a frame, until the wall is drawn.
- `FireState.lastShade` reports the colour the last mark took.

**Readings.**
- One colour for the whole mark stands in for the game's per-vertex colours over the clipped triangles. A mark is
  0.75-3.4 units across, and a world triangle's colour barely changes over that.
- The collision hull and the drawn world are separate meshes. The probe's 4.8 units cover the gap between them.
- The grenade's scorch (`grenade.ts`, the grenades' file) still draws bare. It should take `surfaceShade` the same
  way.
- A viewer mark was not clipped to its polygon, so on a stair's edge it hung past the step. Closed in §14.

**Evidence.**
- Pictures, in `test-fixtures/screens/effects/` (git-ignored, game data):
  - `marks-before-*.png`: the tree before the fix;
  - `marks-after-*.png`: after it;
  - `marks-pair-*.png`: the two side by side, for Frostfire's metal container, Desert Glory's stone wall, Bitter
    Jungle's dirt and Bitter Jungle's wooden stairs.
- Before, every mark is a light grey smudge with a pale rim. After, the holes are dark and the rim is the wall's own
  tone.
- No console frame of a mark was found. `logs/parity/s4_pcsx2` is two clients idle in a round (30/30 throughout).
  The evidence is the packet above.

**Verification.**
- `viewer/test/markShade.test.ts` pins:
  - the colour under a point, interpolated;
  - hidden draws ignored;
  - the solid base under a blended overlay;
  - the 4.8-unit reach;
  - the most opaque coplanar layer;
  - `markMaterial`'s graph reading the vertex colour, blended source alpha over, with no depth write;
  - a round's mark painted with the colour under it;
  - a late wall painted a frame later;
  - unity without a shade.
- `e2e/effects.spec.ts` ("the marks take the colour of the wall they are on"): Frostfire's container marks take
  (0.508, 0.508, 0.523, 1) and Desert Glory's stone marks (0.126, 0.123, 0.110, 1), with their pictures.

## 14. Round five: the mark clipped to the world, shaded per vertex (2026-09-29)

**The game's build, read whole** (`FUN_003b3ab0`, decomp 306491-306670). For each visual of the hit node flagged
`0x10000` (`FUN_003139e0` 213893), each triangle of the visual:
- **faces the round**: its stored normal (the visual's normal stream, `+0x40`, s16/32768) dotted with the round's
  direction brought into the node's frame (`FUN_003b3950` 306426) is below **-0.01** (306534); else it is skipped;
- **lies within 4.8** of the mark's plane: all three vertices, projected by the mark's matrix (`FUN_00307810` 206431:
  a look-at along the round, x and y scaled by `(w - 1) / (size * w)` and offset 0.5 -- the bitmap's u and v -- z the
  depth along the round), have `fabs(z) <= 4.8` (306632);
- **meets the square**: `FUN_003bf290` (313290) -- the projected triangle's u range and v range each overlap the
  square's (`DAT_004b5070`..`DAT_004b5068`; not initialised in the decomp, 0 and 1 by the matrix's offset).
- The triangle then goes **whole** to `FUN_003b3800` (306386) with its three vertices' colour words -- one pool entry a
  triangle (`iVar11 == 1`, 306654) -- and the GS draws it with the bitmap clamped.

**The budget.** None per mark: the loop has no cap. The cap is the pool's, and the pool counts **triangles**:
`FUN_003b3800` takes one entry from `FUN_003bf1a0` (313254: refused past `base + overflow`) for each triangle, and
`FUN_003bf110` (313233) trims whole entries back to the base, oldest first, each frame. `TEMP_DECAL_POOL` `BASE 150`,
`OVERFLOW 50`: 150 world triangles of bullet marks and footprints together. A mark over 1-5 triangles leaves 30-150
marks standing, not 150.

**In the viewer** (`viewer/src/markClip.ts`):
- `MarkClipper` walks the drawn world (the map group `surfaceShade` reads: visible meshes with a `color` attribute,
  less the detail and reflection passes and the flares), takes the triangles in the square's box, `MARK_DEPTH` either
  side along the round, and applies the three tests above. The facing normal is the winding's (CCW front, mesh
  SEMANTICS §6), turned by a mirroring placement.
- Each kept triangle is clipped to the square (Sutherland-Hodgman on u and v in [0, 1]); each output vertex takes the
  triangle's colour interpolated there, which is the gouraud colour the GS gives that pixel. The same pixels as the
  game's whole triangle under a clamped bitmap, drawn with less fill.
- **The node.** The game marks the hit node's visuals only. The viewer's world is one mesh per texture over the whole
  map, and a prop a mesh or instance per placement; so the node is "the world" or one prop placement, the one whose
  triangle lies nearest the hit under the square's centre (solid before blended). A mark on the ground by a crate stays
  off the crate.
- Every layer of the node takes its copy, as the game's per-visual copies do; a fading terrain layer's copy fades
  with its vertex alpha. `lastShade` is the most opaque layer's colour under the centre.
- One small mesh a mark, in world space, its buffers made once (`MARK_CLIP_MAX_TRIANGLES` 32 world triangles, a
  buffer bound and not the game's). Nothing drawn under it yet: the bare square at unity, clipped again four a frame.
- Fire's temporary pool counts triangles (`TEMP_DECAL_TRIANGLES` 150), oldest marks hidden first. The footprints keep
  their own pool of meshes [the game shares one; not joined here]. The grenade's scorch (permanent pool) is clipped
  the same way, framed on the probed ground's normal negated (research 85 section 7.3; since 8a4e853e, §15).

**Readings.**
- The `(w - 1) / w` texel-centre scale of the uv is not applied (a 16-texel bitmap: 6 %).
- The viewer's node rule stands in for the game's node: a world chunk in the game can be smaller than "the world".
- A big triangle sloping away along the round is dropped whole, as the game drops it: at a grazing angle the far
  vertices pass 4.8.

**Cost** (`viewer/test/markClip.bench.ts`, a 1024 x 1024 world of 131k triangles in 96 world meshes plus 300 props,
512 random hits, 5.4 world triangles kept a mark): **0.08-0.12 ms a mark** mean (p99 0.2-0.4 ms) on the host under a
game run's load. Each geometry's cell index is built on the first mark that reaches it: 60 ms for that whole world,
once.

**Verification.** `viewer/test/markClip.test.ts`: a mark on a stair's edge stops at the edge; a lower step within reach
takes the part past it on its own surface; a mark in a corner covers both faces, each with its own colour; each clipped
vertex's colour equals the world's interpolated at that point; the facing and 4.8 tests; instanced props through each
instance's matrix, hidden draws skipped; the lift and the reused buffers; `Fire.setClip` (the clip, `lastShade`, a wall
drawn late); the pool counting triangles; a footprint and a scorch over a step's edge.

## 15. Round six: the clipped mark never clipped in the page (2026-09-29)

**The report.** Controller, the integration head: on Frostfire, walk, `setCamera({ yaw: 100, pitch: -3 })`, every
round on the container (material 25) left `lastShade` null and a light bare square -- `squareInto`, nothing kept;
`e2e/effects.spec.ts` "the marks take the colour of the wall they are on" timed out on it; the MP71 release sweep's
magazine at the nearest wall left no mark (not this cause: see the end of this section).

**Not the streaming.** `MarkClipper` walks the live group on every clip; nothing is snapshotted. With every world and
prop draw revealed, as `main.ts` builds it, the clip still kept nothing (`viewer/test/markClipMaps.test.ts`, RED).

**The cause: the frame looked along the round.** The container side the round meets is two triangles 20 x 15 units
(`container_blue01`, from (786.5, 115, 599.7) to (783.1, 130, 619.4)). The round comes in about 13 degrees off the
wall's normal; along it, one vertex lies 4.88 units from the plane through the hit, past 4.8, and the 4.8 test drops
the triangle whole. Every wall of the maps' size hit at any slant went the same way; the synthetic tests' small
triangles square to the round never did. §14's reading "a big triangle sloping away along the round is dropped whole,
as the game drops it" is **retracted**: the game shows these marks.

**The game's vector is the hit's normal.** `FUN_003d0ba0` (323919) hands `FUN_003139e0` `&uStack_20`, the hit
record's +0x10 scaled by -1 (`FUN_00309180(-1.0, record + 0x10)`, 323891); the record is `point, t, normal, node`
(+0x1c the node, 323818; 0x20 a record, `FUN_002d4c20`). `FUN_00307810` looks along that one vector and picks its up by it
(206461-206476), and `FUN_003b3950` tests facing against it: a triangle is kept when its normal is within 90 degrees
of the hit's (`n . -N < -0.01`). So the square lies flat on the hit surface, and a flat wall is at depth 0 whatever its
size and whatever the round's slant. [Reading: +0x10 as the normal rests on the record's layout and on the facing test
making sense only so; the round's direction there would keep back faces.]

**The fix.** `Fire.placeClipped` builds the frame along the hit normal negated (`markFrame(point, n, -n, side)`); the
footprints already did (`Effects.footfall`). Verified: `markClipMaps.test.ts`, Frostfire's container four rounds at
yaw 96.25-103.75 (0.508, 0.508, 0.523) and Desert Glory's stone at 36.25-43.75 (0.126, 0.124, 0.110), each equal to
the probe's colour there to 5 places and the mark's own vertices that colour.

**The grenade's scorch: done 2026-09-29 (8a4e853e).** `grenade.ts` `groundUnder` probes the game's column under the
blast (`FUN_003c7af0` 318876 -> `FUN_002d4c20`) and `scorchClipped` frames the scorch on that record's normal negated
(`FUN_003d0ba0` 323891), as the marks are; pinned by `viewer/test/grenadeScorchSlope.test.ts` (MP6's hillside `g157`).

**The MP71 "no mark" was not this.** The release sweep chose its heading by the least walk reach (yaw 135 from spawn
(1199, 45.7, 1450)); a level round from the eye along it meets only `INVISIBLE_DI` (72.1, 124.1, 147.4 units) to the
M4A1's range, and `INVISIBLE_DI`'s `PENETRATION` is 1, which `HandleIntersections` passes over by rule (`FUN_003c9b70`
320028-320030: `if (fVar15 != 1.0)`), so nothing was struck and no mark is the game's answer. The sweep's heading was
the defect: `tools/sweepHeading.ts` now picks the nearest first strikable surface (`PENETRATION` != 1) and records
`noSurface` when there is none (launch fix PL-1; `tools/test/sweepHeading.test.ts` pins the MP71 numbers).

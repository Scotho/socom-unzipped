# redotcom: SOCOM Unzipped for the browser, the map viewer and reCOM mode

SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs' multiplayer maps, read byte for byte out of **your own copy of the disc** and drawn again in
a browser with three.js -- and, in reCOM mode, walked and fought over as a SEAL in a match of your own, with every
speed, jump, reticle, round, sound, effect and rule read from the game's own data or its decompiled code. Nothing is
pre-baked and no game asset is in this repository. It runs at
[socomunzipped.com/redotcom](https://socomunzipped.com/redotcom/) (it was `/map-viewer/` until 2026-09-29, and the old
address redirects; the owner named the project redotcom everywhere that day).

It is a spin-off of [**SOCOM Unzipped**](../../README.md), the static recompilation of the game for PC, and lives in that
repository's `web/redotcom/` directory as **a separate project**: its own tests, docs and CI, building alone and
deploying as a static site. `web/` is one npm workspace for three parts: this,
[`../landing`](../landing/README.md) (the site socomunzipped.com) and `../shared` (the design system both use, in
[`../shared/ds`](../shared/ds/README.md), and the site's deploy). It needs nothing from the recompilation and the
recompilation needs nothing from it (see
[What the viewer takes from the rest of the repository](#what-the-viewer-takes-from-the-rest-of-the-repository)).
An agent working on the recomp can skip this directory entirely.

**This is the local demo** (owner, 2026-10-01): the teaser the site serves at `/redotcom/`, single player. Its one match
is the offline match, the round's room run inside the page ([Offline match](#offline-match)). The online match -- the
match server, its WebSocket transport and deploy, the Online setting and the players-online count -- was extracted
from this repository and lives in the separate redotcom project; the page here joins no server and asks none for
anything.

## What it is

- **A map viewer.** All 22 multiplayer maps -- geometry, textures, lighting, fog, LOD, detail textures, collision,
  spawns -- decoded from the disc's archives and drawn as the console's Graphics Synthesizer drew them, on WebGPU or
  WebGL2, with a free-flying camera and a PS2 presentation (the console's 640x448 frame stretched as a television did).
- **reCOM mode.** Walk the maps as a SEAL: the game's third-person camera and movement law, the SEAL's own model and
  motion clips, jumps, stances, ladders, climbing, peeking and wading, the M4A1 SD and the Mark 23 with the game's
  accuracy and recoil, grenades, the game's HUD, sounds and effects. The views are third person and the scope; there is
  no first person (the owner's ruling). reCOM mode is the settings' **Mode** switch's **Play**, on every page, and opens
  on foot. It plays a match on its own -- the round's room run in the page, classic (respawn off, the game's
  create-game default), with the round's damage, death, scoring and scoreboard read from the game
  ([The match](#the-match-web-sprint-3)); `&nomatch` keeps the free walk.
- **A worked example of recreating a PS2 game in the browser** from its own data: see
  [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for which parts are general PS2 and where to start with another game.

## What it is not

- **Not an emulator.** No PS2 code runs; the engine's data paths and rules are re-implemented in TypeScript.
- **Not the game.** No campaign, no AI, no online play (that is the separate redotcom project's). It connects to no
  server.
- **Not a source of game data.** You supply your own disc (the page opens your `.iso` in the browser; nothing is
  uploaded). The repository ships no archives, textures, models, sounds or code from the game.
- **Not affiliated** with Sony Interactive Entertainment or Zipper Interactive.

**Start here if you are a new agent or contributor:** the latest sprint is web sprint 3, "the round"
([spec](docs/specs/2026-09-29-web-sprint-3-multiplayer-design.md), [plan](docs/plans/2026-09-29-web-sprint-3-multiplayer.md));
before it, web sprint 2, "the SEAL in the world"
([spec](docs/specs/2026-09-28-web-sprint-2-the-seal-in-the-world-design.md), [plan](docs/plans/2026-09-28-web-sprint-2.md)),
web sprint 1, "the engine's world" ([spec](docs/specs/2026-09-28-web-sprint-1-the-engines-world-design.md),
[plan](docs/plans/2026-09-28-web-sprint-1.md)), and the viewer's first design and polish
([design](docs/specs/2026-09-20-web-map-viewer-design.md), [polish](docs/specs/2026-09-26-web-map-viewer-polish-design.md)).
The byte-level format authority is [`docs/research/72-mp-map-archive-anatomy.md`](docs/research/72-mp-map-archive-anatomy.md),
and the meaning of every vertex lane is [`packages/mesh/SEMANTICS.md`](packages/mesh/SEMANTICS.md). Comments in the
code cite research notes by number (`research 84 §3`: notes 71-91 live in `docs/research/` here, lower numbers are the
repository's [`../../docs/research/`](../../docs/research/)) and the decompilation's Ghidra function names
(`FUN_00xxxxxx`). The behaviour every change is checked against, maps and pictures included, is pinned down in the
Playwright specs under [`packages/viewer/e2e/`](packages/viewer/e2e/) (`npm run e2e`); the viewer's chrome is the s2u
design system, read in place from `../shared/ds/` (`index.html` links `/src/ds/index.css`, which
`packages/viewer/vite.config.ts` aliases there; no copy since 2026-09-29).

**Licence:** GPL-3.0, the repository's ([`LICENSE`](../../LICENSE)); see [Licence](#licence).

## How it works (one paragraph)

`@s2u/archive` reads the ZDB table of contents and the ZAR/ZED containers inside it. `@s2u/scene`
reads the map's scene graph (`MP*_GEO.ZED`) into nodes with matrices, walks it the way the engine did,
and places every model, plus the clutter from `CLUTTER.ZAR` and the collision hull. `@s2u/mesh` walks
each model's DMA chain, decodes the VIF1 unpacks into vertices exactly as VU1 would have, and reads the
GIFtag templates for what the packet was (a mesh, a line strip) and how it was to be drawn.
`@s2u/gs` decodes the textures and palettes (PSMT8 with CT16/CT32 CLUTs, PSMCT16 and PSMCT32) and the
GS state block each texture's bind packet sets. `viewer` builds three.js objects from all of that in a
worker, draws them with a shading graph that does the GS's own arithmetic (modulate, clamp, fog,
brighten, blend) in the order the engine drew them, and puts a fly camera in front of it.

## Build

### Prerequisites

- **Node 24** or newer (the tools use `import.meta.dirname` and top-level `await`).
- **A disc tree**: a directory with `RUN/MP*.ZDB` in it, from your own SOCOM II disc (US retail,
  SCUS-97275). The viewer needs only those 22 archives, about 224 MB. See the next section for where
  to get them. A player needs neither: since web sprint 1 the page opens the `.iso` itself
  (**Open your own disc**, or drop the file on the page) and reads the archives out of it as ISO9660 in
  the browser, byte for byte what the served tree would hold, nothing uploaded anywhere.

### What the viewer takes from the rest of the repository

The viewer needs **no recompiled game, no toolchain and no emulator** — nothing from the
recompilation's build (`build.sh`, `recomp/`, `third_party/`, `tools/`). What it does take:

1. **The disc tree.** The recompilation's launcher and tooling read the game out of your own ISO into
   `game/disc/` ([the root README](../../README.md), "The user supplies their own disc image");
   `tools/extract-maps.ts` defaults to that location. You do not have to go through the
   recompilation to get one: mounting the ISO (double-click on Windows, `hdiutil` on a Mac,
   `mount -o loop` on Linux) gives you the same `RUN/` directory, and that is all the extractor reads.
2. **The research.** The format is documented in [`docs/research/`](../../docs/research/) — `36` for the
   archives, `13` for the VU1 world-object program the vertex decode mirrors, `31` for the brighten
   and the blend equations, `26` for the GS state — and the design specs in `web/redotcom/docs/`. The code
   cites the notes by number.
3. **reCOM**, the open-source re-implementation of the engine vendored under `recom/`, which is where
   the engine's draw order (`zRender/zrndr_pipe.cpp`) and the scene-graph hookup
   (`zVisual/vis_main.cpp`) were read.

### Commands

Run from `web/redotcom/` (npm finds the workspace root, `web/`, itself; from `web/` add `-w @s2u/redotcom`):

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `npm install` | workspace install (redotcom's six packages plus `tools`, and the landing site and `shared`) |
| `SOCOM_DISC=/path/to/disc npm run extract-maps` | disc tree → `public/maps/RUN/*.ZDB`, the shared archives beside them (`COMMON_ARCHIVES`: `READERC.ZAR`, `ZWEAPON.ZAR`, the motion packs, and the sound's `SOUNDRDR.ZAR`, `SOUNDS/BNKSTORE.ZAR` and `IRX/LIBSD.IRX`), `index.json`, and three test fixtures. **Run this first.** (`SOCOM_DISC` defaults to the repository's `game/disc`, two levels above `web/redotcom/`.) |
| `npm test` | vitest over every package; the fixture-backed tests skip when the extractor has not run |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc` over the five library packages, the viewer and `tools` |
| `npm run dev` | Vite at `http://localhost:5173` |
| `npm run build` | the viewer as a self-contained static site in `dist/viewer/` (~830 kB, 220 kB gzipped) |
| `VIEWER_BASE=/redotcom/ npm run build` | the same, to be served under a path prefix (the site's, `/redotcom/`) |
| `npm run e2e` | Playwright: loads all three fixture maps, asserts the stats, toggles the overlays, writes screenshots |

**For developers: `?devmode`.** Opened by its plain address the viewer reads only the visitor's own disc image: it shows
the disc page and makes no request under `maps/`. Add `?devmode` (its presence is enough) and it reads the served,
extracted tree from `public/maps/` as it always did, falling back to the disc page when `maps/index.json` does not
answer (`packages/viewer/src/source.ts`). The e2e specs and the measuring tools under `tools/` add it to their URLs; do
the same by hand, e.g. `http://localhost:5173/?map=MP2&mode=play&devmode`. It is not shown anywhere in the page.
| `npm run dump-textures -- RUN/MP2.ZDB` | every texture to PNG, both pixel orders and both CLUT orders, plus contact sheets |
| `npm run dump-sounds -- MP2 [dir] [.STEP_STONE ...]` | a map's 989snd sounds rendered to WAV, with each one's length, peak and RMS (`docs/research/81-sounds.md` §11) |
| `npm run export-gltf -- RUN/MP2.ZDB` | one map's world mesh to a `.glb`, for Blender or a glTF validator |

### Deploying

`dist/viewer/` is a static site. By default the page reads the visitor's own disc image in the browser and asks the
server for no game data. `?devmode` reads a `maps/` directory beside it instead, holding what `extract-maps`
wrote from your own disc (`maps/index.json`, `maps/RUN/*.ZDB`, and since web sprint 2 `maps/RUN/READERC.ZAR` and
`maps/RUN/ZWEAPON.ZAR`, the SEAL's tuning and the weapon table; with the sound, `maps/RUN/SOUNDRDR.ZAR` and
`maps/RUN/SOUNDS/BNKSTORE.ZAR`, and `maps/RUN/IRX/LIBSD.IRX` for the SPU2's reverb presets). The archives are the game's and are never part of the build. The sound banks are read
**by range** -- a map's three banks and `HUDUI.bnk` (about 1.9 MB for Frostfire), plus a lent bank or two, not the
67 MB store -- so the server must answer HTTP `Range` requests
(nginx and Vite do); one that does not still works, fetching the whole store.

**socomunzipped.com serves `maps/` today, by the owner's choice and for now.** The site's nginx
(`web/shared/deploy/site/nginx.conf`, `location /redotcom/maps/`) serves the owner's extracted archives, mounted from
the box (`docker-compose.yml`) and uploaded by `web/shared/deploy/site/deploy.sh maps`; the plan is to take it down
and leave the site disc-only. The landing's credits say so (`web/landing/src/claims.test.ts` pins the wording).

**Single player, always** (the local demo, owner 2026-10-01; before it the site's build switched multiplayer off with
`VITE_S2U_MULTIPLAYER=off`, 2026-09-30). There is no build switch: every build is the page the site serves. It has no
**Online** section and no players-online count; it asks nothing of any match server; `online=`, `mp` and `server=` in
an old link are ignored and taken out of the address; and both Controls lists end with "Multiplayer · off in this
build". The **offline match** (reCOM mode against yourself, the room run in the page,
`packages/viewer/src/net/loopback.ts`) is single player and needs no network.
`packages/viewer/test/localDemo.test.ts` holds the sources to it.

**Deploy the viewer before the maps.** Since web sprint 2 `index.json` is `{ maps, common }` -- the map list and
the shared archives -- rather than a bare array. The new viewer reads both forms; an old viewer fails on the new
index. So a server moving to web sprint 2 takes `dist/viewer/` first and the re-extracted `maps/` after it.

## Layout

Everything below is relative to `web/redotcom/`.

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `packages/archive` | ZDB table of contents, ZAR/ZED v2, compiled `.rdr`, and the `AssetSource` the rest read through (`/node` for the file system, `http` for the browser) |
| `packages/gs` | GS texture and palette decode, and the GS state block (`ALPHA`, `TEX1`, `TEST`, `CLAMP`) per texture |
| `packages/mesh` | the DMA-chain walk, the VIF1 unpack, and the vertex-lane interpretation that yields `MeshData` and `LineStrip`; `SEMANTICS.md` is the authority |
| `packages/sound` | the sound (`docs/research/81-sounds.md`): 989snd banks out of `BNKSTORE.ZAR`, SPU ADPCM, the grain sequencer and voices rendered at the game's volume and pan, `sounds.rdr`, the `SOILS` materials' step sounds, the weapons' and zAnim callbacks' sounds, and the rules for when a step, a landing or a round sounds |
| `packages/scene` | world root, scene graph and node matrices, the engine's walk order, clutter, collision, the measured spawn table, the SEAL's tuning off `READERC.ZAR` (`tuning.ts`), the weapon table off `ZWEAPON.ZAR` (`weapons.ts`), the engine's segment test (`segment.ts`), the zAnim effect commands, the thrown casing's flight, the particle sources and the effect models (`effects.ts`, `effectMotion.ts`, `effectParticles.ts`, `effectModels.ts`) |
| `packages/viewer` | the Vite app: renderer, shading graph, fly camera, map picker, overlays, diagnostics panel, the offline match (the round's room, `src/net/room.ts`, run in the page by `src/net/loopback.ts` on the shared sim, `src/sim.ts`), the Playwright e2e |
| `tools/` | the extractor, the dump/export tools, the comparison instruments, the release sweep, `build-corpus.ts` |
| `docs/research/`, `docs/corpus/` | the research notes (71-91) and the AI-readable corpus built from them (`llms.txt`, `records.jsonl`, `sections.jsonl`) |
| `docs/specs/`, `docs/plans/` | the viewer's own design specs and plan, kept here rather than in the repository's `docs/superpowers/` so the recomp's agents do not have to read past them |
| `public/maps/`, `test-fixtures/` (ignored) | your extracted game data; never committed |

## Controls

The camera flies like a creative-mode build camera: momentum, not teleporting. The page lists only the controls of the
mode you are in, in the **Controls** popover in the top bar (hover it, focus it, or click or tap it; **Esc** closes it).
It has two tabs, **Controller** and **Mouse & Keyboard** (owner, 2026-09-29), each the action and its button or key and
nothing else -- no sources, readings or debug keys, which live in this README's tables below. The tab chosen is remembered
(`s2u.viewer.controlsTab`); with nothing chosen it opens on Controller when a pad is connected, else on Mouse & Keyboard
(`viewer/src/controlsList.ts`, `padControlGroups`, `controlGroups`, `chooseTab`).

**Playing as a SEAL is reCOM mode**, the settings' **Mode** switch (**Explore** / **Play**, owner 2026-09-29). In
reCOM mode the page also has walk mode, the SEAL's body, the rifle, the HUD, the Sound and Mouse look sections and the
touch stance and fire buttons. In the map viewer none of that is rendered, bound or answered: no `G`, no Start, no Fly /
Walk switch, no walk in the Controls popover, and the debug hook's `setMode('walk')` returns false. The switch works at
run time, both ways, without a reload (the disc you opened stays open), and is remembered in this browser
(`s2u.viewer.recom`); the address's `mode=play` / `mode=explore` beats that for the visit, and Explore is the default.
The switch is on every page load: no flag gates it (owner, 2026-09-29: "&redotcom can die now. The mode replaces it"),
and an old link's `redotcom` has no effect and is taken out of the address (see **Shareable links** below; `viewer/src/features.ts` `PlayUi`,
`viewer/src/shareUrl.ts`). reCOM mode **opens on foot** (owner, 2026-09-29): the map starts walking once its body and clips are ready.

**The fly camera is Explore's** (owner, 2026-09-29: "Block the fly automatically and disable it while in play mode";
`viewer/src/flyAccess.ts`). In Play a player cannot reach it: there is no Fly / Walk switch, `G` and the pad's Start do
not toggle, the Controls lists name no toggle, the debug hook's `setMode('fly')` returns false, and a `fly` in the
address is ignored and taken out of it. The developer's `?devmode` keeps all of that: `&fly&devmode` opens Play on the
free camera (the e2e specs and the measuring tools do, and enter the walk themselves), and `G`, Start and the switch
toggle walk and fly as before.

The settings panel starts folded on every device, so a first visit is the map and a small bar. **Settings** (the cog),
**Controls** and **GitHub** sit together at the right of the bar in that order (owner, 2026-09-29), one size; the cog
folds the panel away and back, and the choice is remembered. A failed load unfolds the panel so the error is seen.

The panel (polished 2026-09-29 at the owner's ask, for usability and readability) is one column of sections in the
order a player reaches for them -- **Mode** first, since it decides which sections follow, then **Map**, **Picture**,
**Mouse look** and **Sound** (Play's own), and the developer's **Advanced** -- each a heading and at most a
line of plain help. A choice of a few options is always a segmented switch, an on / off always a switch, an amount always
a slider with its value beside it; each switch's tooltip says which option is the default. On a touch screen every
control is at least 44 px tall. The **Controls** popover's two lists are grouped (Move, Combat, Stance & action,
Weapons, General; the fly lists are Move and General); both lists' General group ends with "Multiplayer · off in this
build" -- the local demo has no online match.

The panel's first line is the product's name, `redotcom` (the design system's kicker): no players-online count.

The settings, in the panel's order:

| setting | choices (default first) | in the address | remembered as |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mode** | Explore (free camera) · Play (as a SEAL) | `mode=explore` · `mode=play` | `s2u.viewer.recom` |
| **Map** | the picker; or open your own disc (.iso) | `map=MP2` | `s2u.viewer.lastMap` |
| **Picture** | Modern (fits your screen) · PS2 (640x448 on 4:3) | `view=modern` · `view=ps2` | `s2u.viewer.look` |
| **Mouse look** (Play) | sensitivity 0.05-4x (1x); invert up / down (off); equal up / down (off) | -- | `s2u.viewer.mouseLook` |
| **Sound** (Play) | volume 0-100% (100%); mute (off) | -- | `s2u.viewer.volume`, `s2u.viewer.muted` |
| **Advanced** | the developer's diagnostic switches, lighting and fog | -- | not remembered |

The Sound and Mouse look choices are kept in this browser only (`localStorage`) and start from the defaults on a
first visit. The fold of the panel itself is remembered (`s2u.viewer.panelOpen`), and so is the Controls tab
(`s2u.viewer.controlsTab`).

**Shareable links** (owner, 2026-09-29; `viewer/src/shareUrl.ts`). The page's state lives in its address and follows every
change (`history.replaceState`: no reload, no history entries), so copying the address bar gives a friend the same setup:
`mode=play` or `mode=explore`, `map=MP2`, `view=modern` or `view=ps2`. On load the address beats what the browser
remembers; a setting the address leaves out takes the remembered choice, which is then written in. A value the page
does not know is ignored. `devmode`, `lag=` and the developer's other parameters pass through untouched (never added),
and so does `fly` with `devmode` (without it `fly` is ignored and taken out). The retired `redotcom` and `rules=`, and
the online match's `online=`, `mp` and `server=`, have no effect and are taken out.

### Flying (Explore; in Play only with `?devmode`)

| input | what it does |
|---|---|
| click the canvas | captures the mouse; look is then free. **Esc** gives it back |
| drag | looks, for touch screens and anywhere pointer lock is refused |
| `W`/`S` | fly along the look direction — nose down and `W` descends |
| `A`/`D` | strafe, always level with the horizon whatever the pitch |
| `Space` / `Shift` | up and down in world space |
| double-tap `W`, held | boost, with the field of view widening to match. **Flying only**: there is no sprint in walk mode from any input (double-tap `W`, the pad's R3, the touch stick's rim-hold). Nothing is bound to `Ctrl`: `Ctrl+W` closes the tab and no page can prevent it |
| wheel | trims the fly speed between 0.1x and 16x; the Controls popover shows the trim |
| `Q`/`E` | down and up, kept from the earlier bindings |
| arrow keys | look, at a steady rate, for a keyboard with no mouse to hand |
| `F` | fullscreen, and back (also the button under the frame counter) |
| `` ` `` | hides and shows the panel and the frame counter, for a clean look at the map; the site bar stays |

### Walking (reCOM mode)

| input | what it does |
|---|---|
| `G` (`?devmode` only) | walk and fly. Walk stands the SEAL on the game's own collision hull, sliding along walls at a body radius of 3.5, seen through the game's own third-person camera; the panel's **Fly / Walk** switch (the Modern / PS2 switch's own markup) mirrors it, and entering walk drops you onto the floor under the camera, or onto spawn A |
| `W`/`S`, `A`/`D` | run and back up, strafe, at the game's speeds; a touch stick pushed part way is a part stick, as a pad's is |
| mouse (captured) | turns the SEAL (yaw) and tilts the camera (pitch, between the game's aim limits) |
| `Space` | jump |
| `C` | the stance: a tap toggles stand and crouch (from prone, a tap crouches); held 0.4 s, prone (`STANCE_HOLD_S_PLACEHOLDER`, the pad's Triangle's too); `Ctrl+C` stays the browser's. On a touch screen, the **C** button beside the lift buttons is `C`: tap and hold alike, its release the tap, a cancelled touch nothing (the walk's touch layout hides it and puts Triangle, the pad's rule, in its place, so today it shows only in the fly camera, where it does nothing) |
| right button | steps the zoom: third person → the scope (drawn from the SEAL's eyes, the body hidden) → third person. There is no first person: the views are third person and scoped, as SOCOM II's (the owner, 2026-09-29). The Mark 23 has no scope: with it the zoom does nothing (the owner's ruling, 2026-09-29). On a wide screen the scope's black fills the frame beside it |
| left click (captured) | fires the rifle; held, it fires at the rifle's rate. The click that captures the mouse does not fire. On a touch screen, **SHOOT** |
| `R` | reloads (the pad's R3); an empty magazine waits for it |
| walking into a ladder | climbs it, as the game does with no button: the stick climbs and descends at the game's 7.59 a second, the head and the foot step off ([research 86](docs/research/86-traversal.md)) |
| `X` | the action, the pad's Cross: opens or shuts the door under the reticle (the door icon shows it; [research 92](docs/research/92-doors.md)), climbs the crate, container or fence the climb icon offers (in the air too: jump, then `X`), and slides down a ladder |
| `Q` / `E` held | peeks left / right, standing still, as the game's d-pad does |
| `1` / `2` | the main weapon (the rifle) / the sidearm (the Mark 23), as L1 / L2: the game's swap clip plays |
| `3` / `4` | the kit's equipment slots 1 and 2, in the kit's order (`mp_seal1`: the M67, the HE); R2 on the pad steps through every item |
| `Tab` (held) | the round's scoreboard, as SELECT held on the console ([`docs/research/87-hud.md`](docs/research/87-hud.md) §12); the pad's Select too |
| `M` | the tactical map, and back (SELECT on the console; SOCOM II's single-player map over the map's `AIMAPS.MPS`, heading-up, drawn over the world with the HUD hidden: [`docs/research/87-hud.md`](docs/research/87-hud.md) §9); `-` / `=` held zoom it out and in |

### The controller

The Gamepad API's standard mapping, read as the PS2 pad by position. The left stick moves and the right looks, flying and
walking alike. The layout is the owner's word of 2026-09-28 where it says so; a row marked *assumed* in the page is one
neither the owner nor the repository documents (`viewer/src/gamepad.ts`, `PAD_LAYOUT`).

| button | walking (reCOM mode) | flying |
|---|---|---|
| left stick / right stick | move / look | fly along the look / look |
| Square | jump | up |
| Cross | action: the door under the reticle ([research 92](docs/research/92-doors.md)), the climb the icon offers, the ladder's slide ([research 86](docs/research/86-traversal.md)) | — |
| d-pad Left / Right (held) | peek left / right, standing still | — |
| R1 | fire (held fires at the rifle's rate; let go stops) | — |
| Triangle | stance: a tap toggles crouch, a hold goes prone, a tap from prone stands up | down |
| L1 | the rifle (the game's SwapWeapon1); no held aim, no first person | — |
| d-pad Up / Down | zoom in / out, a step a press (the scope; research 84) | — |
| Start (`?devmode` only) | fly (as `G`) | walk (as `G`) |
| L3 | fire mode (research 84 section 6) | — |
| R3 | reload, as `R` (the owner's ruling, 2026-09-29, and the game's own: `controller.rdr`'s Default binds R3 to Reload) | — |
| Circle | — (the game's TeamCommand, which the viewer does not have) | boost (on R3 until R3 became the reload) |

Triangle's hold length is a guess, `STANCE_HOLD_S_PLACEHOLDER` (0.4 s, `viewer/src/stanceButton.ts`, `C`'s too): the game
reads the button's pressure, which a browser pad does not give. Triangle keeps the game's own rule, where a tap from prone
stands up; `C` and the touch **C** button take the owner's PC rule (2026-09-29), where a tap from prone crouches.

**Walking is the game's player** (web sprint 2): the camera behind and over the SEAL's shoulder, the game's speeds
and fall, a stand-in body, the game's reticle and rifle. The numbers and where each came from are under
[What the picture is made of](#what-the-picture-is-made-of), "The player". In short: 65 units a second running, 37
backing up, 14 crouched, 11 prone; a step up to 6.5 units is climbed, a drop of more than 8 is a fall. `Space` jumps
as the game does ([research 80](docs/research/80-the-jump.md)): under 15 units a second the standing jump, a clip on the
floor (`seal_jump`, 0.99 s, the body's root and the camera rising 3.6); from 15 the running jump, 79.9 up 0.1 s after
the take-off under the 235 fall -- 12.9 units (1.3 m) high, 0.78 s in the air, the take-off's speed carried; prone cannot. The
clips are the game's pick and blend: the stick's speed picks each set's clip by its transition band, the forward and
strafe sets share the stick's angle, every clip plays at the rate its root needs. While walking, the game's own HUD is drawn
over the picture (`viewer/src/hud.ts`, [`docs/research/87-hud.md`](docs/research/87-hud.md)): the ammo box, the
compass turned by the heading, the info box (health, a static round timer, the range), the stance word on a change and
the context prompt (the climb icon, a door's within its 30 units); the round start as the console plays it (a fade from
black, "STARTING ROUND 1 OF 11", then the objective); the compass's nav marks (the map's own nav points, C..Z); hidden in
flight.

**The walk sounds** with the game's own sounds, decoded from the map's banks (`docs/research/81-sounds.md`): a
footstep per foot of every run or walk cycle, in the sound of the surface underfoot (the collision polygon's material:
metal on Frostfire's rig, sand in Desert Glory), the stealth step at a light stick and the crawl prone; the jump's
whoosh and the landing (the surface's, or a bone's crack from a deadly height); the M4A1 SD's suppressed round and its
reload; the SPU2's own reverb at the mission's indoor and outdoor depths; the mission's ambience beds and its looping
emitters (a fan, a river, insects at a lamp). Where a map's banks lack a sound its floors or grenades ask for, the same
sound is lent from another map's bank (a placeholder, research 81 §7). The browser starts sound on the first click or
key press; `window.__viewer.audio()` reports what played, what was dropped and why.

**The rounds show** with the game's own effects (`docs/research/89-effects.md`). Each round plays the weapon's zAnim
muzzle animation out of the map's `CZANIM.ZAR`. For the M4A1 SD that is the brass casing thrown to the rifle's right,
tumbling, bouncing on the hull with its surface's sound and gone at rest or at 1.2 s. It shows no flash and no tracer,
and no smoke: its smoke source is switched off in the retail data. Where the round lands, the surface's own impact
plays out of the map's `MZANIM.ZAR`: sparks off metal, dust and chunks off stone, a puff off sand, a splash off water.
The surface's own mark comes from `decals.rdr`, the metal's, the stone's, the sand's or the wood's, and none where the
game has none. `window.__viewer.effects()` reports what played; `playEffect(name)` plays any of the map's effects.

The mouse is captured with `unadjustedMovement` where the browser offers it, so the OS's pointer
acceleration stays out of the look. The mouse's look is always raw -- the same turn for the same movement -- and a
controller's always the game's stick curve (`viewer/src/look.ts`); there is no setting for it (owner hotfix,
2026-09-30), and a `mouse: 'stick'` remembered from before reads as raw. `?map=MP7` opens a map by its archive, the picker writes the URL,
and the last map picked is remembered for the next visit.

Starts ramp and stops glide rather than snapping. The velocity is integrated in closed form, so the camera
covers the same ground per second at 30 fps as at 240 — and `setCamera` from the debug hook clears the
momentum outright, which is what keeps the Playwright poses exact. `test/camera.test.ts` pins the motion
model — ramp, glide, frame-rate independence, which axis each key moves along — rather than the tuning
constants, which are meant to be tuned.

## On a touch screen

**Two floating sticks** (owner, 2026-09-29). A finger landing on the left half of the screen is the move stick: a circle
appears where the thumb lands, its knob follows the thumb clamped to the circle, and it goes on the lift. While walking a
finger landing on the right half is the look stick, the same way; flying, the right half keeps the canvas's one-finger
drag. Each half tracks its own finger, so both are held at once. The sticks are a pad: their knobs are the Gamepad API's
standard axes 0/1 and 2/3 (`sticksPad` in `viewer/src/touch.ts`), read by the pad's own `padInput` -- the same dead zone
(0.15), rescale and y flip, and from there the same path a pad's sticks take (the walk's stick law, the mover's analog
run, the look's turn rate). There is no second touch pipeline: `stickInput` is `padInput` of the two knobs, and
`test/dualStick.test.ts` pins that it is, and that the old single stick's shaping is unchanged pixel for pixel. The move
stick held at its rim for 400 ms is still the fly camera's boost.

**Walking on a phone** (reCOM mode) shows the buttons a player needs, tidied, for a phone held sideways: a large
**SHOOT** (R1) at the right edge and **JUMP** (Square) beside it, under the right thumb; the stance (Triangle: a tap
crouches, a hold goes prone) over JUMP and the action (Cross: doors, climb, ladders) over SHOOT; and a row under the
compass with **RELOAD** at the edge, **NEXT** (the next item: grenades and equipment, as R2), and zoom out and in (d-pad
Down and Up). The fire mode, the weapon slots, the peek and the scoreboard are a pad's or a keyboard's. The buttons lie
above the stick zones: a press on a button never starts a stick, and a stick holds its finger, so dragging it across a
button presses nothing. Every button holds the lane the pad's button holds (`touchInput`, merged with the pad's in
`padFrame`, `viewer/src/touch.ts` `attachWalkTouch`), so the behaviour is the pad's; each owns its pointer, so SHOOT and
JUMP can be held at once. No two buttons overlap and the HUD keeps its corners (the ammo box, the compass, the range and
timer strip) at 812x375, 667x375 and 915x412 (`e2e/touch.spec.ts`). Held upright the page asks for a turn and lifts the
cluster off the HUD's tall bottom strip. Flying keeps the lift buttons, the **C** button (`C`'s rule: a tap stands or
crouches, from prone crouches; held 0.4 s, prone) and a round **fire** button.

**A controller on a phone.** A pad connected hides the whole touch layer (`body.pad-on`) and plays exactly as on a desktop
(the Gamepad API path is shared); disconnecting it brings the touch layer back. **The tip**: on a touch device a notice
recommends a controller and landscape, once a visit (the tab's session) and again on each turn to portrait, until its
close button dismisses it for good (`s2u.viewer.mobileTipDismissed`; `viewer/src/mobileTip.ts`).

The touch controls appear on a coarse pointer, or at the first touch event for a hybrid a media query gets wrong, and not
at all on a mouse. A touch drag turns twice as far per pixel as a mouse drag, because a thumb has a phone's width to work
with; a round fullscreen button sits above the lift buttons (at the left edge while walking), which on a phone also asks
for a landscape lock. The canvas is `100dvh`, so the picture's centre is the screen's whether or not the browser bar is
showing, and the pixel ratio starts at 1.5 on a coarse pointer and adapts (`main.ts`, `adapt`): frames over 24 ms step it
down to 0.75, frames under 12 ms step it back up.

Everything the viewer draws over the map goes in one strip along the top: the site bar (the back link, then Settings,
Controls and GitHub, one size, each its mark alone under 480px), with the panel or the Controls popover beneath it. The
panel starts folded everywhere, leaving only the bar (a remembered choice still wins), its body scrolls inside itself;
on a phone held sideways, open, it docks in the top middle band -- right of the fullscreen button, left of the pill row
under the compass, above the SHOOT / JUMP cluster -- so no touch button is under it (it lies over the stick zones, open
ground a thumb on the panel does not reach) (`e2e/phonePanel.spec.ts`, at 812x375, 667x375 and
915x412); upright it is the full width under the bar, as before. The
status line is two dim lines whose whole text is its tooltip. The lift buttons clear the browser's own bottom
bar with `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`.

## Loading a map without freezing the page

Switching maps used to take one 690–1,703 ms frame, and the whole of it was the *first frame that drew
the new map*: `buildWorld` costs 14–20 ms, and then three uploads every texture and geometry and
compiles every program at once. So the build still happens in one go and what is spread out is the
showing — `buildWorld` returns its objects in two queues and `viewer/src/scheduler.ts` hands them to
the scene a few per frame. The world's own meshes go first and the previous map stays up until they
start landing; the props follow behind a map that is already drawn and flyable.

The budget that does the work is a **count**, not a clock: adding a mesh to a group costs about a
hundredth of a millisecond, and the 400 ms is spent in the render that follows, where a time budget
cannot see it. The collision hull — tens of thousands of segments on the larger maps, and off by
default — is likewise held as arrays and only made into an object the first time it is switched on.

Meanwhile the overlay says what is happening: bytes fetched (the archive is read a chunk at a time so
the bar has a real denominator), then the worker's own stages, then the scene build. The map picker is
the only control taken away while a load runs.

## What the picture is made of

Settled on 2026-09-26 (the polish spec linked at the top):

- **The world is drawn unlit, and a multiplayer frame is not brightened.** The EE emits the VU1 light command only
  for a node flagged `m_dynamic_motion` or `m_dynamic_light`; on most maps that is nobody, and the
  vertex colours the exporter baked go to the GS untouched (`viewer/src/lighting.ts`). The campaign's post-process
  multiplies every pixel, fog included, by `1 + FIX/128` twice (FIX 89-93 on the Seeding Chaos spawn), but a
  multiplayer round has it switched off -- the exposure block at `0x488e48` reads enable 0 and pass count 0 on a live
  Frostfire round -- and PCSX2's Vigilance and the recompiled Frostfire agree with the bare frame band for band
  (`docs/research/82-map-fidelity-audit.md`, D1). The viewer opens at FIX 0; the slider keeps the campaign's look.
  The rig from `GlobalLighting` is exact and is applied to the flagged nodes only.
- **The GS state is read off each texture's bind packet** (`gs/src/gsState.ts`, `viewer/src/materialSpec.ts`):
  the blend equation (source alpha, additive on 212 glows, none on the cutouts), the alpha test and its
  reference (`GREATER 64`, exactly half), the filtering and mipmap request, and the wrap mode per axis.
  Nothing about a texture's alpha is guessed from its pixels any more, except whether it has any.
- **Fog is the GS's linear ramp with the altitude band**, as a fog node of its own (`viewer/src/fog.ts`):
  `F = clamp(w*scale + offset) * clamp((y - bottom)/(top - bottom))`, the second term read off the EE's
  own setup and parked at the engine's off values (`-10000`, `0.001`) on the sixteen maps without it.
  A packet whose GIFtag clears `FGE` — every sky, moon, star, water plane and self-lit surface on every
  map (`tools/dump-fge.ts`) — takes no fog, which is what puts the horizon back.
- **The camera is the map's**: a 49° vertical field (`m_vfov`, a half-angle of 24.5°), 46° on Rat's Nest, kept at any
  screen shape, so a wider screen sees wider (78° across on 16:9) -- the owner's ruling of 2026-09-29; the console's 70°
  crop and a 1.537:1 pillarbox stay on the record (research 88), not in the panel.
- **The PS2 picture** (the Modern / PS2 switch at the top of the panel): the 640×448 frame the console
  drew, projected with the map's own half-angles and stretched onto a 4:3 box the way the television
  did, smooth (the owner's ruling of 2026-09-29; not nearest-neighbour). The choice is remembered. Everything else the panel offers is under **Advanced**.
- **Backface culling is the visual's own flag.** Bit 3 of each visual's `vparams` word is the cull
  the EE emits (`FUN_003b5f20`, `flags & 8`; `VISUAL_FLAG_CULL` in `scene`). Across the maps it is
  clear on exactly the things drawn from both sides -- Frostfire's ladders, whose rungs used to vanish
  from behind, grates, fan blades, Bitter Jungle's foliage, Desert Glory's grass, rugs, the glow quads
  -- and set on the solid objects. It replaces the old rule that culled wherever the texture was solid.
- **One state per object.** A map's graph holds every state of a destructible (`healthy` beside
  `whats_left` and the debris `parts`), a lamp beside its `nolight` copy, and the crates' pulsing
  objective ribbon. The game switches them by play; drawn together they z-fight. The viewer draws the
  intact, lit ones and hides the rest (`LoadedMesh.alternate`, "alternate states" in `options` shows them).
- **Each placement draws its own baked light.** A model instanced in several places carries a chunk per instance
  context, differing only in its prelit vertex colours; `hookupVisuals` numbers the contexts in load order, the copies
  inside the prototypes first and the world's placements after them (`contextsBefore` in `scene`), and each placement
  draws its own (`instanceShades` in `loadMap.ts`). Frostfire's tank rails drew the prototype's bare material colour
  before, neon beside the prelit bridges (`docs/research/82-map-fidelity-audit.md`, D2).
- **The mip level is the GS's.** A mipmapped texture samples the level `TEX1` gives off the depth,
  `(log2(w) << L) + K` clamped to `0..MXL`, not the GPU's derivative LOD; with the corpus's K of -12 to -6.5 most never
  leave the base level (`gsMipLod`, `world.ts`'s `gsTexel`; research 82, D3).
- **The mip levels are the disc's, and the reflective surfaces get their pass.** A mipmapped texture uploads the records
  its `MIPTBP1` names (a detail texture's level 1 is transparent: the detail fades with distance). A draw whose visual
  names a textured `Material_Palette` entry -- the water, glass, ice -- gets VU1 `0x34`'s environment-map pass: a sphere
  map of the reflected eye ray in the entry's texture and colour, faded by its rim alpha (`world.ts`, `envVertex`).
  The PS2 picture renders with no antialiasing, as the GS did (research 82, D3b, D5, D6).
- **LOD by range.** `READERM.ZAR/lod.rdr` pairs models into bands with fade-in and fade-out ranges
  (`railings_high` out at 100-120 units where `railings_low` comes in, on the same rails), and the
  world root's `LOD_Object` holds the same numbers squared for `CVisual::DrawLOD` to compare the
  camera's range against. Each placement of a banded model is its own mesh and fades across its band as
  `DrawLOD` scales it: the ramp is linear in the range *squared* (the disc stores `1 / (far² − near²)`),
  so the two copies of a pair sum to one across the crossover and each is at half at 110.45 units, not
  110 (`lodOpacity` in `scene`; a copy at rest keeps its shared material and only a fading one takes a
  blended twin, `viewer/src/lodFade.ts`). The "scaled" range `GetScaledRangeSquared` is a stub in
  reCOM, so the plain distance is used.
- **Facades face the camera because the disc says so.** `m_facade` (node flags bits 8-9) marks the
  lamp flares, the stars, the moon and the sun -- 41 nodes over 22 maps -- and applies to everything
  under a flagged node, as the engine's matrix stack does. It replaces the old guess that turned
  every graded single quad, which also turned the drop shadows.
- **Scrolling textures scroll.** The world root's `TextureScroll_Object` names the nodes whose uvs
  the engine steps each tick (Frostfire's `ocean_1..3` and `skyhorizon`, by 0.02-0.04); those chunks
  get a uv offset the viewer advances at the field rate (`SCROLL_TICKS_PER_SECOND`, an assumption
  until a capture settles it).
- **Drop shadows are a decal pass** ("prop shadows" in `options`, on by default): every draw whose
  texture is a `shadow*.tif`, blended source-over after the world with no depth written and a polygon
  offset off its ground, whatever the draw-order mode.
- **The engine's grid is built, and its draw order is a switch.** `grid_params` in every world root is
  reCOM's `tag_GRID_PARAMS` (atom count 8192, posts 16, the cell dimension, the cells across and down; no
  origin is stored, it is always 0): Frostfire is 160 units, 8 × 9. `scene/grid.ts` generates the cells as
  `CGrid::Create` does, files every placement, clutter instance and collision-owning node into each cell its
  bounds cover -- one atom per cell, the bound chopped to single precision as the EE chops it, which is what
  reproduces the console's census of 414 world atoms and 117 prop atoms on Frostfire -- and walks the rings
  outward from a cell in reCOM's diamond (`|dx| + |dz|`). `CPipe::RenderWorld` draws in that walk with depth
  written under every blend (`ZMSK = 0`, research 26 §2); the viewer can ("engine draw order" under
  Advanced, recomputed when the camera crosses a cell, shadows and decals after the last ring). It is off by
  default: the 22-map sweep is identical either way, but near-first with depth under every blend makes a lamp
  flare drawn before the pipe behind it cut a rectangle out of it, so that is not the whole of what the
  console did for the flares, and their pass is the open question. By default blended draws go to three's
  back-to-front sort with no depth written; each draw's place in the scene-graph walk (`LoadedMesh.order`)
  stays as the tie-break.
- **The detail texture pass is drawn.** `mp<N>_lib.rdr`'s `detail{name, uv, range, bmode}` per texture is
  the record the engine compiles into every visual (2,395 of 2,395 visuals with a bound texture carry one);
  the viewer draws a second mesh over the base's geometry with the detail texture at `uv` times the base's
  uvs (8 on Frostfire's oil-grime floor, 2 to 10 across the disc, not the 4.0 the mission dumps showed),
  blended as `bmode` says (`COLORBLEND` is `ALPHA 0x44`, `ADDITIVE` is `0x48`), depth less-or-equal (the
  records' own `GEQUAL`) with no depth write, fading per fragment to nothing at the root of the squared
  `range`. The engine switches the whole pass on per visual by its centroid's range instead; the viewer's
  merged draws have no centroid, so it fades (the sprint's W1.R7). "detail pass" under Advanced.
- **The spawns come from the disc.** `AIMAPS.MPS` -- not a ZAR -- is fully decoded (`scene/aimaps.ts`,
  `docs/research/75-aimaps-mps.md`): a head, per sub-map a header, the cells as row spans and eight counted
  tables, and a trailer with the spawn list of 24 slots a side, each a cell with a side bit and a facing.
  `PlayerStart` turned out to be one named cell, not a region. The slots are drawn under the **spawns** toggle
  as a cell outline and a facing arrow per side, each standing on the probe's floor under its centre (all 1,058
  do), beside the measured A and B; the camera opens at A's (x, z), 20 units over the probe's floor there (on
  the 20 maps whose A is the orbit camera's position that is 12.7-31.2 units lower than the recorded y + 20 it
  used to stand at), and which of the 24 a player gets is game logic (A was always side 0's first slot and B
  side 1's second in the recorded rounds).
- **The ground is the engine's.** `scene/probe.ts` is the game's ground probe (`FUN_002d3030`'s per-model
  gate, the vertical line, first hit per model in surface order, the pick chosen as research 24 §2 says),
  over the grid's collision atoms: 3,318 world-space polygons on Frostfire, the engine's own count once the
  `di` the exporter copies onto nested instance nodes -- which the engine never keeps -- is dropped. The four
  actor-measured spawns land within [−3, +1] of it; the forty online-sweep rows in `spawns.ts` turned out to
  be the orbit camera, 25 units above the floor and 23 behind the actor. The walk (`viewer/src/walk.ts`) is a
  60 Hz fixed-step mover on that floor.
- **The shading is the GS's modulate, in the GS's order** (`world.ts`): `(texel * vertex) >> 7`, the
  product clamped by `COLCLAMP` *before* the fog is mixed in, then the post-process's `1 + FIX/128` as a
  uniform on every material rather than a factor baked into the vertex — so an overbright vertex under
  fog comes out as the hardware had it, and moving the brighten slider rewrites nothing. The
  `(Cd - 0) * As + Cd` light maps are drawn with their own equation: the shader emits `As` and the blend
  is `Cs * Cd + Cd`, the fix the game's own GL backend made (research 31 §12).
- **The line strips are drawn** (`options`, on by default): one pixel wide, textured along the strip
  with the uvs the packet carries (they run well past 0..1, so the texture repeats along a rope),
  gouraud, fogged and blended — `PRIM = IIP|TME|FGE|ABE` on all 194 packets — as one `LineSegments`
  per (texture, fog) with the same shading graph the meshes use. Desert Glory's power lines and lamp
  brackets, Crossroads' tent ropes and light filaments.

### The player

Settled in web sprint 2 (the sprint 2 spec's §7, cited by finding):

**The speeds are the game's file, the ramp and the fall its code** ("The game's movement law: the ramp is on the
stick, the speed is linear in it, the fall is 2.4 g"). `READERC.ZAR/motion.rdr` gives each SEAL clip a
`max_velocity` in metres a second (`scene/src/tuning.ts`, pinned against the disc's file): at `MetersPerUnit` 0.1
that is 65 units a second forward at a full stick, 37 back, 65 strafing; the crouch bands 14.8, 13.5 and 15, which
the crouch plays at 0.946 of them whatever the push (14.0 ahead, 12.8 back, 14.2 aside); prone 11 crawling and 5.5
sideways, along one axis, from the first tick. The ramp is on the stick, not the speed (`FUN_00586c10`): each axis
moves toward the pad at 2 to 5 stick units a second, so a full push is at 90 % on tick 11 and full on tick 12, a
fifth of a second; the speed is linear in the stick (`FUN_0058bdf0`), a released stick stops at once, and a full
push in crouch (0.838 or more, with 19 units of headroom) stands the SEAL up and runs (`FUN_00584c60`). A drop of
more than 8 is a fall under `dynamics.rdr`'s gravity 235 units a second squared, 2.4 g (`FUN_0059b440`), the
horizontal speed held from the edge: a 42-unit drop lands in 0.60 s (`viewer/src/walk.ts`).

**The camera is `FUN_0029a950` and `FUN_0029bf70`, nothing fitted** ("The game's camera: the pitch pulls the eye
in, there is no tether, and the console's eye falls out to 0.001"; `viewer/src/playerCamera.ts`). The target is
the skeleton root's height plus a ramp that saturates at 10 above a root of 5.6; the eye lies along the look,
pitched, `28 − 14 × |n.y|` from it, so it comes in as the camera looks down or up; the rest pitch is
`init_aim_pitch`, −9.167°. There is no tether (`cam_tether_stiff` has no reader): the collision pass pulls the eye
in at once to 0.75 short of the hull and lets it out at 3 % a frame after 1.5 s. Crouched at the spawn that puts
the target 15.378 over the feet and the eye 19.603 over them and 24.906 behind -- the console's placed eye on the
spawn dump, to 0.0003; standing, the target is 21.484 and the eye 25.709 up.

**The stances and the body are measured on the console's dump and frame** ("The SEAL is 19.6 units tall, and the
console's spawn dump holds a crouched player"). The skeleton root is 11.484 over the feet standing (the 24 actors at
the bind pose) and 5.504 crouched -- the dump's player is crouched: its root under the game's own stance test of 9.0,
a knee on the ground; prone 1.8 is an estimate. The body (`viewer/src/body.ts`, `bodyView.ts`) is the game's own:
the map's player character out of `CLIB_MDL.ZED`, skinned on its `CLIB_GEO.ZED` skeleton, its gear hung where
`READERC.ZAR/character.rdr` says, played by the game's clips out of `MOTION_P.ZAR`
([research 78](docs/research/78-character-mesh-and-skeleton.md), [research 77](docs/research/77-motion-format.md));
the bind-pose SEAL is 19.431 units tall. (Web sprint 2 began with a 19.6-unit stand-in measured on the frame; the
real model replaced it.) The scope's eye, 18.3, is an estimate.

**The reticle and the rifle are the disc's** ("The console's reticle: two bitmaps at one texel per pixel, a
65-pixel cross on the frame's centre"; "The SEAL's rifle and the game's own bullet mark"). `HUD2_TXR.ZED`'s
`ret_rifle_01.tif` (a 64×64 ring and dot) and `ret_rifle_02.tif` (a 32×32 arm, drawn four times) at the console
frame's size, one texel to a PS2 pixel, scaled by the height / 448 in the Modern picture (`viewer/src/reticle.ts`).
The rifle is `ZWEAPON.ZAR`'s M4A1, first in every `mp_seal1` kit (`scene/src/weapons.ts`): `FireWait` 0.12 s (500
rounds a minute), 30 rounds and three magazines -- the console's "30/30 · 2 MAGS" -- and a 1000-unit ray against
every polygon of the hull (`viewer/src/fire.ts`); where it lands goes `decals.rdr`'s `bullet_mark_stone.tif` off
`EFFE_TXR.ZED`, 1 to 1.8 units wide.

**The gunplay is the game's** ([research 84](docs/research/84-accuracy-and-recoil.md)): the SEAL's M4A1 SD
(`HELD_RIFLE`) fires to `Maximum_Range` x 10 units; its reticle opens with the walk, the look and each round and closes
at the weapon's own per-stance rates (`viewer/src/accuracy.ts`), halved in third person; a round climbs the whole
reticle up the screen (the recoil you see unscoped -- the camera does not kick there) and goes inside it by the
game's cone; semi, burst and automatic (`B`, L3; burst at spawn); the right button steps the view third person -> the 3x
scope and back (no first person: the owner, 2026-09-29), d-pad Up and Down step it in and out (`viewer/src/zoom.ts`, the scope's tube and dashed cross off `HUD2_TXR`).

**The rifle is in the SEAL's hands, raised to fire as the game raises it** (the sprint 2 player spec's §6, "The rifle
in the hands, the Fire set, the kick and the satchel"). The body makes a `rifle` node under `rhand` with the rifle in
hand (`FUN_00553290`); the clips' `rifle` track (`weapon` in the few SOCOM 1-named ones) poses it and the M4A1 SD
hangs on it at its grip (`viewer/src/heldItem.ts`). The trigger raises the rifle over 0.1 s and it stays up 5 s after
the last round, then falls over 0.5 s (`FUN_005dfe30`, `FUN_005dfc80`, the controller's 5.0 s at `FUN_00598280`;
`viewer/src/weaponRaise.ts`); while up, each clip's **Fire** version (`seal_fp_stand`, `seal_fp_walk`,
`seal_fp_crouch` ... twelve pairs, `FUN_005e0690`) blends in at that weight (`viewer/src/weaponPose.ts`, a pose layer
over the clips). A round leaves the posed weapon's `firepoint` toward the point under the reticle; in a scope the
first round of a pull kicks the aim's pitch by the stance's `FireRifleKick*` (`FUN_005b91c0`/`FUN_005b9280`, on in the
image, gated to the scope as the game gates it: research 84 section 8; `viewer/src/rifleKick.ts`), and `R` plays the stance's reload clip for its `motion.rdr` playback (1.6 s standing).
The satchel is hung but hidden, as the game hides it until the SEAL picks up the bomb (`FUN_0059df60`). `Fire`'s
`subscribe` is the audio's hook: a `round` event (the weapon's name, id, muzzle animation and sound names, the fire
point in the world, the end, the hit, the rounds left), `reloadStart` (its seconds) and `reloadEnd`.

**The sidearm is the kit's Mark 23, on L2** (the player spec's §6, "The sidearm, the swap and the reload"). Every
`mp_seal1` kit is M4A1, Mark 23, M67, HE: the controller's L1 and L2 slots are 0 and 1 (`FUN_00598280`), so L1 (`1`)
takes the rifle and L2 (`2`) the Mark 23 (`a_mark23`, `scene/src/weapons.ts` `HELD_SIDEARM`: 12 rounds, semi, `FireWait`
0.2, reticle set 0, `mark23_icon.tif`, `.MARK_23`); R2 steps the inventory through them and the throwables, and the
M67 is no longer on L2 (`viewer/src/kit.ts`); on the PC `3` and `4` take up the kit's equipment slots 1 and 2 (the M67
and the HE, `grenade.ts` `equipmentSlots`). The Mark 23 does not zoom (`zoom.ts` `zoomsIn`: the
owner's ruling of 2026-09-29, over the game's one-mode rule that sent it to the 9x view). The
swap plays the game's clip (the MOTION workstream's
`WalkMode.swapWeapon`): the rifle rides `spinelo` on the clip's own track and is slung at `character.rdr`'s offset, the
pistol comes out of the hips or the holster at the clip's hand-off (0.72 standing) and goes back into the `rthigh`
holster. The kit runs on the walk's own clock for the clip (`WalkMode.swapProgress`), so a standing swap the stick
turns into the moving one carries on at its phase; each weapon hangs from its clip's own track, never a cross-fade of
the hand's and the back's (`Animator.heldLocal`), and eases over 0.4 s from where it was drawn when its mount changes
(`heldItem.ts` `MountEase`): no jump at the swap's ends. The pistol's clips (`seal_p_*`), Fire versions (`seal_pfp_*`) and reloads (`seal_p_reload` ...) follow
`m_item`. A reload puts the next magazine in at its start and keeps a part-used one in the ring; an empty magazine
reloads by itself 0.01 s later, a dry trigger clicks (`dry`); walking faster than 20 a second turns a still reload
into the moving one. The accuracy pip (`ret_accuracy`) marks a raised muzzle blocked short of the point under the
reticle (`FUN_005aa6e0`, `FUN_00215250`). In the scope the page draws none of the SEAL, as the game draws none in its views from the eye.

**The HUD is the game's** ([`docs/research/87-hud.md`](docs/research/87-hud.md)): `CHUD`'s own rectangles read out
of the ELF -- the ammo box's `newweapnbkrnd.tif` over x -10..160, y 364..439, the weapon icon at (20, 389), "30/30" and
"2 MAGS" at scale 0.9 on the baseline 382, the fire-mode rounds at x 10, 51, 87, the compass ring `compass_lo.tif` at
96x96 on (565, 90) turned by the heading, the info box's health bar at (488, 396) -- drawn from `HUD_TXR`, `HUD2_TXR`,
`HUDW_TXR` and `FONT_TXR` (the font a PSMT4 texture `@s2u/gs` now reads, every HUD bitmap stored bottom row first) with
`fonts.rdr`'s `font_text_01` glyphs; each element's pixels within a pixel of the console frame's (`e2e/hud.spec.ts`).

## Known gaps

- **The swap's hand-off phases are a reading.** The phases at which a weapon changes hands (0.72 / 0.82 / 0.62 /
  0.79) are read from the clips' callbacks, not settled, and the 0.4 s ease between mounts is the viewer's own
  (a named reading). The scoped sway moves the rounds but nothing on screen, as in the game as far as it was read
  (no reader of it that draws was found: [research 84](docs/research/84-accuracy-and-recoil.md) section 8); a
  console check would confirm.
- **Some effects are open.** The tracer's travelling model, a lifetime count-down on marks and footprints, and the
  skinned body under a light's pass (research 89 section 8). Maps with no game explosion effect show stand-in
  sprites for a grenade's blast.
- **The walk is the decompilation's reading, not yet measured on the console.** The speeds, the ramp and the fall
  are the game's tables and the decompilation's law (`viewer/src/walk.ts`'s header); the console measurement
  (W2.2c: the instruments and the recipe are in the tree, [research 79](../../docs/research/79-seal-speed-on-the-console.md))
  waits for a window the owner names. Until it runs the prone root (1.8), the prone body (3.0), the scope's eye
  heights (the eye 18.3 standing, and the crouched and prone eyes derived from it) and the crouch and prone body
  columns are estimates, and two numbers are readings only: the crouch diagonal's speed-up along its axis (19.8 at
  45°) and the headroom ray's start (the feet + 14). The steep-ground slide is not modelled (research 86 section 6.2).
- **A kerb between 6 and 6.5 units over a lower floor is passed over.** The floor selection takes the highest
  floor at or under the feet + 6, so such a kerb, climbable by the step rule, is walked under for the floor below
  (inherited from the selection, not the step rule's). The record's layer mask is probed as all layers (the
  literal reading contradicts research 24's own walk); and the slot outlines are drawn without a depth test
  because a slot's cell is flat where its ground is not (362 of 1,058 have a corner more than a unit off the
  floor under the centre).
- **The HUD pass has not been seen under WebGPU.** The reticle's layer is pinned by the e2e, but no one has yet
  looked at it on a WebGPU browser (W2.4's review); that look is owed.
- **Region culling, the flares' place in the engine order, the LOD twin.** The per-node region bits (node flags
  13-17) are on the disc on 8 maps and the collision polygons carry masks over the same bits on 6, but the
  writer of the camera's visible set (`CanSeeRegion`'s other operand) is not in the tree, so nothing is
  culled by region; and the engine draw order stays a switch until the pass that keeps a flare from cutting
  the wall behind it is found (the sprint 1 spec's §7), the LOD twin under that order with it. The two facade
  modes are drawn alike, reCOM's `ComputeFacadeMatrix` being a stub.
- **Animated map objects beyond the uv scrolls and the doors are not drawn.** The doors swing (`actions.rdr`'s `DOOR`
  records and their `MZANIM.ZAR` animations, [research 92](docs/research/92-doors.md)); the destructible states and
  the particle effects (`COMMON/EFFE_*`:
  `fire_hardedge.tif` and the smoke sprites) are driven by game code the viewer does not run; the
  flames are effect emitters, not map geometry.
- **The one EE-animated `FIX` glow** (`lightglow.tif` on MP61, `(Cs - 0) * FIX + Cd`) is drawn additive:
  its factor is game logic, and at rest it draws nothing.
- **The auto-exposure is a slider.** A multiplayer round never runs it (the viewer opens at FIX 0, as the round
  draws); the campaign meters `FIX` per frame from a grid of frame pixels and applies it twice, which the viewer
  leaves to the slider.
- **The ISO source is proven on one retail disc.** It reads ISO9660 (the primary volume at sector 16, `;1` names,
  files by LBN), was checked against images written by an independent library in four flavours (plain, Joliet with
  Rock Ridge, a UDF bridge, El Torito), and has read the retail US image (4,380,753,920 bytes): one volume of
  2,139,040 blocks, 349 files, all 22 `RUN/MP*.ZDB` named; the gated test runs with `SOCOM_ISO` set to the image
  ([research 93](docs/research/93-data-hardening.md) section 3). An image shorter than its volume is refused at open,
  naming the two causes: a truncated file, or a Node `fs.openAsBlob` Blob over a file above 4 GiB, whose size Node
  reports modulo 2^32 (a browser's `File.size` is exact). A dual-layer dump's second volume is read where the first
  lacks a path, as PCSX2 and Open PS2 Loader find it (proven on a synthetic image only: no SOCOM II disc is
  dual-layer). A raw 2352-byte `.bin`, a multi-extent file and an interleaved one are refused by name rather than
  read.

## The match (web sprint 3)

The round, as the page plays it on its own ([Offline match](#offline-match)): the game's classic match, its rules read
from the game (research 91). The online match of web sprint 3 -- the Node match server, its `/ws` transport, `/rooms`
and `/health`, its deploy, the Online setting, joining as a player or a watcher -- was extracted from this repository
on 2026-10-01 (the owner: "with multiplayer extracted and it just being a local demo") and lives in the separate
redotcom project. Its research stays here (research 91, the round; the dated web sprint 3 spec and plan under
`docs/specs/` and `docs/plans/` are the record of their day and still describe it).

**Classic only** (owner ruling, 2026-09-29: "Remove the respawn option entirely for the time being. No mode
selection."). The respawn ruleset's code stays in the tree behind one switch, `RESPAWN_RULES_ENABLED` in
`packages/viewer/src/net/protocol.ts`; its tests turn it on. The match length is the game's `mp_max_rounds` (11, the
create-game default), the count the round-start banner shows.

| key | in the match |
|---|---|
| the walk's keys | as in the free walk: the page predicts its own SEAL and the room agrees (W3.R8) |
| Tab / Select | the scoreboard: the game's sort, the dead dimmed |

A match is **classic** (respawn off, the game's create-game default); there is no Rules choice, and an old link's
`rules=` is ignored and taken out of the address. In the game a match starts once both sides have a player: 11
rounds, first to 6. A round
ends when a side has no living player (tested from 15 s in; "ALL TERRORISTS ELIMINATED" / "SEALS VICTORIOUS!", 23 s
more, then ROUND COMPLETE) or at 00:00 as a draw. There is no respawn. The dead see "You have died." and wait for the
next round. Level after round
11 plays a tiebreaker ("PLAYING TIEBREAKER ROUND"), and another while it is drawn. Every round starts everyone at the
side's start slots with a full kit. Scoring: +2 a kill, +1 alive at the end, +5 each on the winning side. The rules and their sources are in research 91 section 19.

### Offline match

reCOM mode plays the match on its own: the page runs the round's `Room` (`packages/viewer/src/net/room.ts`, once the
match server's, moved into the page on 2026-10-01) behind a socket that never leaves the page
(`viewer/src/net/loopback.ts`), and joins it with the match client (`viewer/src/net/client.ts`, which opens no
connection of its own) -- so the round's clock and banners, the game's damage (rounds, falls, grenades), deaths,
respawns, scores and the scoreboard come from one implementation. The player is the host's side, the SEALs; nobody
is kicked for idling; under classic the round starts with the one player and runs to its clock (`SOLO_ROUND_PLACEHOLDER`: the game launches only with both sides seated).
`&nomatch` keeps the free walk of before, and so does `&fly` (the tests' and the tools' opening). The rules and their
sources: [research 91](docs/research/91-the-round.md) section 20.

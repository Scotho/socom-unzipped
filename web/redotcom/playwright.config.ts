/**
 * One headless chromium against one Vite dev server, serving the extracted disc tree from
 * `web/redotcom/public/maps/`. Nothing here runs in parallel: the point is a picture of a map, and the host is
 * shared with the game build. Specs pass `&devmode`: without it the page reads only the visitor's disc and makes no
 * request under `maps/` (`packages/viewer/src/source.ts`; README "Deploying"). Most open with `&fly`, which also keeps
 * the offline match off (`&nomatch` does the same on foot; `e2e/soloMatch.spec.ts` is the one that plays it).
 *
 * The port is overridable (`E2E_PORT`): 5173 is also Vite's own default for `npm run dev`, so a
 * session already running the dev server -- or another agent's -- can be holding it, and
 * `reuseExistingServer` would then attach to that unrelated server instead of this worktree's source.

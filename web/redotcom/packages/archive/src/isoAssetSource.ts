/**
 * The player's own disc image as an `AssetSource` (design spec §3.1, milestone M5): a `Blob` -- a `File`
 * from the page's file input or a drop is one -- read as ISO9660 (ECMA-119) in the browser, so the site
 * serves no game bytes and the image never leaves the machine. Nothing here needs the DOM beyond `Blob`,
 * so the same class runs under node for the tests.
 *
 * What it reads is what `tools_py/iso_lbn.py`, the repository's reference reader, reads, and what the
 * SOCOM II engine itself relies on when it loads everything by LBN: the Primary Volume Descriptor at
 * sector 16, the root directory record inside it, and the directory records under that, each naming a
 * file's extent (first logical block and length). Every byte is fetched with `blob.slice(a, b)`, so an
 * archive costs one range of the file and nothing is read that no one asked for: the tree is walked
 * lazily, one directory at a time as a path passes through it, and the path table is not used.
 *
 * Out of scope, and refused by name rather than misread: a raw 2352-byte-sector image (`.bin`/`.img`
 * from a CD ripper), a logical block size other than 2048, files recorded as multiple extents or
 * interleaved, and an image shorter than the volume its descriptor declares (a truncated file, or a Node
 * `fs.openAsBlob` Blob over a file above 4 GiB, whose `size` wraps modulo 2^32 on Windows). The Joliet and
 * UDF descriptors a DVD also carries are ignored: the primary volume holds every file under its ISO9660
 * name, which is the name the engine asks for.
 *
 * A dual-layer PS2 DVD dumped whole holds a second ISO9660 volume for layer 1 after the first. Its
 * Primary Volume Descriptor sits at the sector the first volume's space size names (PCSX2
 * `pcsx2/CDVD/CDVDisoReader.cpp` `FindLayer1Start`: when the layer-0 PVD's BP81 block count is below the
 * image's, "the layer 1 start LSN contains the primary volume descriptor for layer 1"), so the layer-1
 * volume starts 16 sectors earlier and its LBNs count from there (Open PS2 Loader `src/bdmsupport.c`
 * takes 16 off that sector for `layer1_start`; `modules/iopcore/cdvdman/searchfile.c` reads the layer-1
 * PVD at `layer1_start + 16` and adds `layer1_start` to the layer-1 root's and files' LBNs). A path the
 * first volume lacks is looked for there. The retail SOCOM II (USA) image is one volume (its PVD's
 * 2,139,040 blocks are the whole 4,380,753,920-byte file), so that path is proven on a synthetic image.

/**
 * A grenade's blast on one SEAL, headless (web research 85 section 7, 91 section 5): what the server's room and the
 * page's single-player match (`./loopback`, the same room) apply to each player a blast reaches. Every rule is the
 * decompilation's; what it does not settle is a named reading.
 *
 * - **Who it reaches** (`FUN_005ac070` L464806-464850): every actor -- the thrower too: nothing asks who threw it --
 *   whose `GetDamage` at its origin is over 0 (or any in a flashbang's), with the line from the blast to its head
 *   node clear (the room's `segmentHit`, `seen` here).
 * - **The reach factor** (`FUN_005a0e70` L459160-459172): `f = 1 - d^2 / r^2`, `d` from the actor's origin (its feet),
 *   `r` the round's `Explosion_Radius`; nothing at f <= 0.
 * - **The ringing ears** (L459221-459227): on the player (the player controller's `+0x2c` answers 1, `FUN_005431f0`),
 *   for anything but a shotgun (weapon ids 'Q'-'T'), `.RINGING_EARS` and every sound channel held at 0.35 for 5 s
 *   (`FUN_003412f0(5.0, 0.35, ...)`).
 * - **The fragments** (`FUN_005a18b0`, L459236-459256): `fragmentCount` of them, each `fragmentDamage` at the feet's
 *   distance on `fragmentPart`'s part at the round's piercing (`./damage`).
 * - **The knock** (`FUN_0057ed10`, stored when fragments struck and the damage at the feet is over 0, L459261-459281;
 *   applied by `FUN_0057e770` L440940-441092): see `blastKnock`.

 * The multiplayer wire protocol (web sprint 3, M3/M4; spec W3.R2-R4, rulings W3.R8-R10 in the sprint spec's section 7).
 *
 * One WebSocket per client. Binary frames carry the hot path -- the client's commands up, the server's snapshots down
 * (`./codec`) -- and text frames carry JSON for everything reliable and rare (`ClientEvent` / `ServerEvent`): the join,
 * names, the queue, kills, respawns, the scoreboard, shots for the effects.
 *
 * The model (W3.R8, the command stream): the client's mover ticks at the game's 60 Hz (`CGame::Tick`, research 71
 * section 1.5) and every tick becomes one `Command`, numbered. The server runs each player's commands through that
 * player's own `Walker` in order, as they arrive -- the same code on the same hull, so the server's mover takes the
 * steps the client predicted, bit for bit (`test/simMap.test.ts`), and a correction is needed only when a command
 * was refused or the two sims disagree. Snapshots carry, per recipient, the last command the server ran and the
 * mover's state after it; the client compares with its own history at that number.
 */

 * 3 (2026-09-29): a command carries the scope's slowed stick (`Button.Scope`) and the kit's hold (`HOLD_SHIFT`).
 * 4 (2026-09-29): the rules -- the hello asks for `respawn` or `classic` (rooms are keyed by map and rules), the welcome
 * and the round start name the rules, the round and the game's round count, and classic's `eliminated` event.
 * 5 (2026-09-29, the launch review): a `fire` names the eye its aim left from and that aim (`eye`, `aim`: the server's
 * accuracy cone, OWNER-3, `./shotCone`); `promoted` says whether the seat is a ghost's; an idle player moved out gets
 * `demoted` (its role is a spectator's from then).
 * 6 (2026-09-29, grenade harm): the snapshot's action codes take the blast's knock (`fallForward`, `fallBackwards`,
 * `landBackwards`, `getUpBackwards`, `./blast`), and the server sends a `blast` event (the ringing ears and the knock).

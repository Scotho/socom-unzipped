/**
 * SOCOM II's frag grenade in walk mode (the grenades workstream; web/redotcom/docs/research/85). The physics is
 * `@s2u/scene`'s `projectile.ts`, the game's own; this file is the page's part: the slot, the held throw, the clip's
 * timing, the grenades in flight over the map's hull, what is drawn, and the events the audio, weapon and UI
 * workstreams hang off.
 *
 * - **The slots.** In SOCOM II a grenade is a kit slot, taken up from R2's inventory or by L1/L2 (`SwapWeapon1/2`)
 *   swapping to the slot assigned to them (research 85 §9.1), and thrown with the fire button (R1). Here: `3` and `4`
 *   the kit's equipment slots 1 and 2 (`equipmentSlots`: the M67, the HE; the page binds them, `./kit`'s `hotkey`),
 *   `1` the rifle back; the pad's R2 (`cycleInventory`, through `./kit`'s inventory: L1 and L2 are the
 *   primary's and the sidearm's slots, the WEAPON workstream's `Kit`); the fire trigger (the left
 *   button, the touch fire button, R1) throws while one is up (`main.ts` routes it).
 * - **The throw.** Held, the power chases the button's pressure (`stepThrowPower`: a key or a click is pressure 1, so
 *   the power is how long it was held: 0.54 at a quarter second, 0.95 at one); let go, `GetThrowAnim` picks the clip
 *   (a toss under power 0.6 with the aim under sin 0.3), played on the body (`./throwPose`), and at its release phase
 *   the grenade leaves the posed right hand's (2, 0, 0) (`GrenadeSource.handPoint`) at `throwVelocity`'s velocity, its
 *   fuse (`Timer1` 3 s) starting then. The smoke pours out from 3 s to 40 s; the flash whites the screen out by the game's rule.
 * - **The flight.** `stepGrenade` at 60 Hz (`FLIGHT_TICK`), over `gridCast` of the walk's hull with the map's
 *   `DefaultMaterial`: gravity 98, the bounce at each material's ELASTICITY_COEFF, the rest under 5 units/s, the
 *   explosion at 3 s where it lies, the removal at 3.1.
 * - **Drawn.** The `grenade` model (`WEAP_GEO`; the HE's `HEgrenade`) on the right hand's held node (`heldNode`;
 *   `HAND_PLACEHOLDER` without a posed body) and in flight (tumbling at `SPIN_PLACEHOLDER`); the explosion as the `frag_grenade` zAnim's parts read off their
 *   commands (`EXPLOSION_READING`): the flash, a fireball, sparks, smoke, dust and a ground roll, with the bitmaps
 *   `GRENADE_BITMAPS` names; the scorch from `GRENADE_BLAST`; while the throw is held, the game's yellow arc
 *   (`drawArc`, `FUN_005970b0`: research 85 §11). Optionally the flight's trail (a debug line, off).

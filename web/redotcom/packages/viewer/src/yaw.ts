/**
 * The yaw's one arithmetic, for the viewer and the server alike (web research 86 section 3.8).
 *
 * SOCOM II keeps a facing as the actor's rotation -- a quaternion (`piVar10[0x14..0x17]` in `FUN_005b2d20`, decomp
 * 468642-468645) and its matrix -- never as an angle, so a facing has no winding and a turn between two facings is found
 * by vectors: `FUN_005b2d20` (468637-468686) brings the facing to reach into the actor's frame, takes `acos` of its dot
 * with the frame's forward (0..pi) and its side from their cross product's y (`FUN_001bfc78`; `fStack_ec < 0` negates
 * it). The viewer carries the facing as degrees (`Pose.yaw`); these two functions are what keeps it equivalent:
 *
 * - `wrapYaw` is the canonical form a yaw is stored in: [0, 360), the range the wire reads a yaw back in (`net/codec`
 *   `qYaw`/`dqYaw`, u16 per turn), so a stored yaw, the command's and the snapshot's are one number;
 * - `shortTurn` is the game's turn between two facings: the short way, signed, whatever either's winding.
 *
 * Nothing else in the viewer or the server may wrap or difference a yaw by hand.

 * `to - from` under -540 (JavaScript's `%` keeps the dividend's sign): a SEAL whose look had gone twice round spun the
 * long way to a ledge (research 86 section 3.8). The exact half turn, where the game's cross product is zero and its

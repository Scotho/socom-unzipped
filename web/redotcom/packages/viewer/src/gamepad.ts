/**
 * The controller (web sprint 2, W2.7; ruling W2.R5, the owner's word of 2026-09-28): a pad drives the fly camera and
 * the walk with one mapping, the game's own layout, through the one input structure the keys and the touch stick
 * already feed.
 *
 * - **The pad.** The Gamepad API's standard mapping (W3C Gamepad, "Remapping": buttons 0-3 the face buttons bottom,
 *   right, left, top; 4/5 the bumpers; 6/7 the triggers; 8/9 back and start; 10/11 the stick clicks; 12-15 the d-pad;
 *   axes 0/1 the left stick, 2/3 the right, y growing down) read as the PS2 pad the launcher maps it to -- by
 *   position, never by a family's letter (third_party/ps2recomp/ps2xShared/include/launcher/mapping.h:48-50, and its
 *   default table, ps2xShared/src/mapping.cpp:16-25: face down is Cross, face up Triangle, and so on).
 * - **The layout** is data, `PAD_LAYOUT`: each row a control, the action, and the source it rests on -- or `assumed`
 *   where the repository does not say what that button does in SOCOM II. Never an assumption presented as documented.
 * - **The input** is `Input`: the move and look pairs and the actions, which `padInput` reads off a pad through the
 *   table and `mergeInput` merges with the touch stick's. The pairs take the touch stick's shaping (`./touch`,
 *   `stickVector`'s dead zone and rescale) without its rim (`padStick`), so the walk can undo it (`padRaw`).
 * - **The watch** (`PadWatch`) says when a pad comes and goes, from the events and from the poll alike.

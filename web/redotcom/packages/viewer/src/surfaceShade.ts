 * EFFECTS (web/redotcom/docs/research/89 §5, "the mark's colour"): the game draws a bullet mark -- and a footprint, and a
 * grenade's scorch, all `FUN_003139e0` decals -- with the vertex colour of the world polygon it is clipped to. For every
 * clipped vertex `FUN_003b3ab0` (decomp 306470) keeps a pointer to the world vertex's own 32-bit colour (the vertex
 * walk's `+0x3c`, `FUN_003ba9a0`: the colour array + index x 4), and `FUN_003beca0` (decomp 313065) unpacks the three
 * words (`V4-8`, `0x6e038006`) with the normal (`V3-16`) into the packet the world's VU program finishes (`MSCNT`):
 * `RGBAQ` is the wall's own baked colour, lit as the wall is lit, and the GS modulates the mark's texel by it.
 *
 * The viewer's world holds exactly that colour in each draw's `color` attribute (`./world`, `applyLighting`: the
 * record's colour, lit where the engine lights it). This reads it where a mark lands: a probe along the surface
 * normal through the point, `MARK_DEPTH` either side, over the visible draws with a `color` attribute (not the
 * blended ones where a solid one is met); the drawn surface nearest the point, its triangle's three colours
 * interpolated there. Where several layers lie on that surface (a terrain's layers: `ground_grassy.tif` fading out by
 * its vertex alpha over `cobble_road.tif` on Vigilance), the game puts a copy of the mark on each visual of the node
 * (`FUN_003139e0` walks them all), each faded by its own layer's alpha; the one that shows is the most opaque, so the
 * layer with the highest alpha is taken. One colour for the whole mark stands in for the game's per-vertex colours
 * over the clipped triangles (a mark is 0.75-3.4 units across; a world triangle's colour barely changes over it).

/**
 * The view state and its zoom (research 84 §7), ported from the SEAL body's `+0x200` byte and its three functions --
 * **without the first-person state**: the owner's ruling of 2026-09-29 is that the views are third person and scoped,
 * as SOCOM II's, so the game's state 1 (first person, 1.01; 2 its vehicle twin) is never entered, and every step and
 * drop that went to it goes to third person (0) instead.
 *
 * - **The states** (`FUN_005448a0`, which sets `+0x200` and the magnification `+0x204`): 0 the third-person view
 *   (1.0); 3 night vision (1.01); 4 the 9x view (9.0, with the `zoom_control` motion); 5 to 12 the weapon's scope,
 *   magnification `ZoomMode[state - 4]` (`FUN_003c5980` with `state - 4`, verified in the disassembly at 0x544adc).
 *   So the M4A1's one scope level is state 5 at `ZoomMode1` 2.5x (the M4A1 SD's 3x); `ZoomMode0` (1.5 on every
 *   record) is never a magnification -- it is only the look's divisor in state 4 (`FUN_005be660`).
 * - **Zoom in** (d-pad Up, `FUN_005445b0`, jump table 0x65c360; the game's 0 -> 1 step taken out): 0 -> 5 when the
 *   weapon has two or more zoom modes, else 4 (night maps: 0 -> 3 first); 3 or 4 -> 5 (two or more modes); s >= 5 ->
 *   s + 1 while `s - 3 < NumZoomModes`. No wrap: the last level stays. A sidearm does not zoom (`zoomsIn`, the
 *   owner's ruling of 2026-09-29): the 9x view and the scope are not its.
 * - **Zoom out** (d-pad Down, `FUN_00544400`, jump table 0x65c320; its -> 1 steps go to 0): 3, 4 -> 0; 5 -> 0 (3 at
 *   night); s > 5 -> s - 1.
 * - **What drops it**: a second round of a pull while scoped (`FUN_005c5340`: the game's state 1, here 0); a weapon
 *   switch from the night vision (`FUN_005c4b10`: 3 -> 1 in the game, here 0, and only 3); death, a vehicle, a ladder
 *   (`FUN_00547af0`, `FUN_005463c0`, `FUN_00579720`: 0). Not a reload, not a stance change, not moving -- which is cut
 *   to 0.2 while scoped.
 * - **The animation** (`FUN_001f1610` / `FUN_001f0750`): the magnification runs linearly to its new value at 3 x the
 *   target a second in (1 -> 2.5 in 0.2 s), and out at 3 x the old one.
 * - **The FOV**: the camera's projection scale is the magnification (`FUN_0029b2f0`: `cam+0x470/+0x474` = zoom x
 *   the aspect's 1.0), so tan(half FOV) divides by it.
 * - **The look** (`FUN_005966a0`): both sticks' look divided by `FUN_005be660` -- `ZoomMode[state - 4]` when that
 *   index exists, else 1 (the night vision changes nothing) -- and x 0.2 more in state 4.

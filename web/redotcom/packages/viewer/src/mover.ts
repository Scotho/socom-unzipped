/**
 * Walk mode (web sprint 1, W1.4; web sprint 2, W2.2b): a mover that stands on the floor the engine's probe finds,
 * slides along the walls research 24 names, runs at the game's speeds, crouches, goes prone and falls.
 *
 * - **The tick.** `CGame::Tick` (`FUN_001E7040`) runs the game at 60 Hz (web/redotcom/docs/research/71 section 1.5). The
 *   mover steps on that clock from a fixed-step accumulator the page feeds real time into, so it takes the same
 *   steps at 30 fps and at 240 fps; the eye is drawn between the last two steps (`eye`).
 * - **The speed: the law, as read from the decompilation (W2.2b step 1 and its review).** Each actor tick
 *   (`dt = actor+0x2e0`) `FUN_005af930` puts the pad in `actor+0x244` (lateral, controller.rdr's `Strafe`) and
 *   `actor+0x240` (forward, `MoveLong`) -- the move stick as the pad reader leaves it (`./moveStick`: 0.3 dead per
 *   axis, rescaled, x sqrt 2, each axis clamped and the pair never put in the unit disc; the keys a full axis each, so
 *   W+D is (1, 1); web research 88 section 3) -- and `FUN_005870e0` (decomp 445164-445169) runs the ground state by the
 *   stance at `actor+0x174`: 0 -> `FUN_00586570` (stand), 1 -> `FUN_00584c60` (crouch), 2 -> `FUN_005845c0`
 *   (prone). `FUN_00586f00` calls a stick within 0.03 of rest (`DAT_003f3428`) idle: no locomotion, the stop is
 *   at once whatever the stick was.

 *            run sets and blend -- the SEAL stands and runs; the stance word stays crouch, so under 0.838 it is back
 *            to the crouch walk
 *          else: stick x 14 / (|stick| x 14.8) (magnitude 0.946 whatever the push), FUN_00586c10, FUN_00582d10:
 *            ONE set by the class (+0x120 forward, +0x150 back and +0x180 left played at -m, +0x1b0 right) at
 *            weight 1, no blend -- 0.946 x 14.8 = 14.0 ahead, x 13.5 back, x 15 aside
 *   PRONE  FUN_005845c0 -> FUN_00583500: no FUN_00586c10 at all; the class keeps one axis (1/3 forward, 0/2
 *          lateral) and zeroes the other; the crawl (forward, reversed backward) or the prone strafe plays at that
 *          axis's |value|, so the speed is max(|x|, |z|) x the band on the first tick
 *   ```
 *
 *   So the velocity is `m x max_velocity` of the clip the class or the blend picks (`READERC.ZAR/motion.rdr`, at
 *   `MetersPerUnit` 0.1: 65 forward, 37 back, research 25 section 0's (0, 0, -65) and (0, 0, +37)); the ramp is the
 *   stick's, not the speed's: 0 to full in 1 / 5 s, 90 % on tick 11 (0.18 s). `fb_accel` / `lr_accel`
 *   (`DAT_0044c360/364`, `dynamics.rdr` 0.01) and `throt_exp` have no reader in the decompilation besides the
 *   static initialiser `FUN_00400870` and the loader: they do not shape the SEAL's walk. Not modelled: the slope
 *   and water slow-down `FUN_005b56c0` (`DAT_0044c358/35c`) and the root motion's shape within a stride
 *   (the snap's 0.2 s cross-fade is modelled: `throttleSnaps`, `Walker.stickSnaps`). One consequence is kept as read: `FUN_00582d10` calls `FUN_00583350`, whose
 *   `DAT_0064fc80` then scales the crouch walk's single set, so a crouch diagonal runs 1 / sqrt(w^2 + (1 - w)^2)
 *   faster along its class's axis (19.8 at 45 degrees). Research 18 section 3.13's 0.9 s "lead" and its average of
 *   40 are the orbit camera trailing the actor on our recomp at 18.7 frames a second, not this ramp. [reading of
 *   the decompilation; W2.2c measures it on the console, W2.R7]
 * - **Stances.** A tap of `C` toggles stand and crouch (prone to crouch), a hold goes prone (owner, 2026-09-29; the
 *   touch button cycles stand, crouch, prone; nothing on Ctrl -- `camera.ts` says why); each
 *   has its bands, its body column and its skeleton root height (`STANCE`). `Walker.posture` is the body in use:
 *   `stand` while a crouch runs at full stick.
 * - **The floor.** After each sub-step `probeGround` at the new (x, z) and `selectFloor` from the origin y + 5 with
 *   the feet at y (research 23 section 1.1-1.2, research 24 section 2). A floor up to `step_height` 6.5 over the
 *   feet is stepped onto, one steeper than `max_slope` 50 degrees is not climbed, and one higher than 6.5 is refused
 *   like a wall; one down to `ground_touch_distance` 8 under them is stepped down to (`READERC.ZAR/dynamics.rdr`,
 *   reCOM `zCharacter/char_dyn.cpp:17-20`; research 17 section 8's `+0x14..+0x1c`). No floor, and the step is refused.
 *   Known gap, for W2.2c: `selectFloor` takes the highest floor at or under y + 6, so a kerb between 6 and 6.5 over
 *   the feet with a lower floor also under the line is passed over for the lower one -- the selection's behaviour,
 *   inherited, not the step rule's.
 * - **The fall.** Further than 8 down, the mover is airborne. `FUN_0059b440` integrates it: the fall speed
 *   `actor+0x133c += g x dt`, then the height `actor+0x2e4 -= speed x dt` (as here: `vy -= g x dt`, `y += vy x dt`),
 *   with `g` the table's `0x44c250 +0x00` -- the static default `0x42c43333` = 98.1 (1 g in units), overwritten
 *   with `dynamics.rdr`'s 235 by the loader `FUN_0059ba80`, so units a second squared and the SEAL falls at 2.4 g.
 *   `g x 0.8` applies only in the `Ladderslide` state (`DAT_003def50`, the string at `0x6620c8`), not a walk-off or
 *   a landing: not modelled. The horizontal velocity is held as it left the edge (no air control: the stick-driven
 *   velocity with `FUN_00586c10` in `FUN_0057a330` runs only in the `Jump` state, `DAT_003deae8` = "Jump" at
 *   `0x661510`), until the probe's floor is met. A 42-unit drop (Frostfire's decks, research 24 section 7 item 4)
 *   takes sqrt(2 x 42 / 235) = 0.60 s.
 * - **The walls.** Research 24 section 2 step 3: a polygon with bit 1 set, bit 18 clear and `|n_y| < 0.7`, met by
 *   the body's column (y + 6 to y + 20 standing) at radius 3.5 (W1.R2); the mover is pushed out along the wall
 *   until it is 3.5 from it, and keeps the part of its step that runs along it. The game's movement collision is
 *   not decompiled -- that walls stop the mover is research 24's inference from the 3c trails, which stand off wall
 *   planes at 4.4-5.8 (section 4.1).
 * - **The view (W2.1, W2.R1).** The game's third-person camera (`playerCamera.ts`): its target `rootY + ramp` over
 *   the feet at the posture's root, its eye behind and over, the pass against the hull, a tick at a time after the
 *   mover's and drawn between ticks; zoomed, the scope's view from the head (`scopeEyeHeight`). There is no first
 *   person (the owner, 2026-09-29: the views are third person and scoped, as SOCOM II's). The mouse turns the body's
 *   yaw and the camera's pitch (`camera.ts`). Sprint 1's eye 15.4 (`EYE_HEIGHT`, W1.R2) is retired as a view; it
 *   stays the height a pose drops the mover from.
 * - **The jump** (web/redotcom/docs/research/80-the-jump.md, read from the decompilation). `FUN_0057e1b0` (decomp
 *   440776-440867) takes the press when the SEAL is on walkable ground (`actor+0x1348` >= cos `max_slope`), not prone
 *   (`FUN_005b4340(.., 0xb)` refuses stance 2), and not within 0.4 s (`actor+0x135c`) of a running jump's take-off or
 *   of a landing. **At 15 units a second or more** (speed^2 >= 225) it is the **running jump**: the `Jump launch` action
 *   (`seal_runningjump_launch`), the take-off's world velocity kept at `actor+0x1350..0x1358` and carried through the
 *   air with no stick (`FUN_0054d9a0`, 416501-416555), and `actor+0x1364 = jump_factor x gravity x -0.4` -- -79.9 --
 *   written into the fall speed 0.1 s later (`actor+0x1360`, `FUN_005af930`): an impulse of **79.9 units a second up**
 *   under the 235 fall, a rise of 13.6 units (1.36 m) and 0.68 s in the air after the 0.1 s wind-up. **Under 15** it is
 *   the **standing jump**: the `Jump` action (`seal_jump`, 0.99 s), and the feet never leave the floor -- the height
 *   comes from the clip only for `UseVelY` motions (`FUN_0059afd0`, 456328-456466), and `seal_jump` is none: the rise
 *   is the skeleton root's, 10.5 to 15.1 over the feet, and the game's camera follows that root. While it plays the
 *   stick drives the SEAL at each set's top speed (`FUN_0057a330` 438955-438985, the only air control: 65 ahead, 37
 *   back, 65 aside standing, 20 crouched). **Landing** (`FUN_005af590`, 466641-466728): over `land_hard_fall_rate` 115
 *   the `Jump land hard` action (`seal_land_hard`, 0.9 s); else, with the stick at rest or the last airborne tick's
 *   velocity under 20 (`actor+0x38`, the fall included: `FUN_005483d0` decomp 413963), `Jump land` (`seal_land_soft`,
 *   0.63 s); else no clip, the run going on from the stick at once (the ramp skipped: `actor+0x248 = +0x244`). Through a
 *   landing clip the carried velocity runs down at 150 a second squared (`FUN_0054d9a0`). A walk-off plays the
 *   in-air clip (`Jump fall`, `FUN_0057e050`) and lands by the same rule.
 * - **The stance changes** (`FUN_005817d0`, `FUN_00581c10`, `FUN_00581540`, decomp 442170-442660): standing to crouch
 *   plays `Stand -> Crouch` (0.60 s) unless moving over 10 a second; crouch to stand the same clip backwards unless
 *   moving over 10; to prone `Stand -> Prone` (0.95 s) or `Crouch -> Prone` (0.85 s), and out of prone those backwards.
 *   The ground state does not run while a transition plays (`FUN_005870e0` runs it only on a locomotion action) [reading].

 *   17 section 1 called 5.504 "standing idle"; the dump's reading contradicts it (under review: W2.1 and W2.2c settle
 *   it). Column 6-14 [estimate]: the standing top 20 x 0.7, the height a crouch keeps; it stays over
 *   `min_stand_height` 10 (`dynamics.rdr`, x10), which reads as the clearance a standing SEAL needs
 *   (`char_dyn.cpp:421-422` names it, nothing here reads it).
 * - **Prone.** `seal_prone_crawl` 11 each way (`motion.rdr` has no backward crawl with a positive `max_velocity`;
 *   `FUN_00583500` plays the crawl at `-|forward|` backing up, the clip reversed), `seal_prone_rstrafe` /
 *   `_lstrafe` 5.5. Root **1.8** [estimate, W2.2c measures]: under the ramp's floor 2.169155, where the camera
 *   stops lowering -- the lowest stance is the one the floor was cut for -- and about a body's half-thickness,
 *   0.18 m, over the ground. Column 6-9 [estimate]: a body lying down is about 0.9 m high with the head and rifle

/**
 * The movement locks (the owner, 2026-09-29: "SOCOM should lock your movement when throwing a grenade or planting
 * certain equipment"): the one-shots the kit pushes on the actor's action stack (`FUN_00588bc0`), by clip. The rule:
 *
 * - **What locks.** A throw (`FUN_005802b0` pushes `GetThrowAnim`'s clip at the release of the button, decomp
 *   441900-441903), the claymore's placing (`Place claymore`, `seal_place_claymore`), and a reload started still
 *   crouched (`|v|^2 <= 400`) or prone (`FUN_005a82e0` 462786-462930: `Rifle crouch reload` / `Rifle prone reload`, the
 *   pistol's `Pistol ...`). None is a `BlendOverlay` motion, so each goes on the stack itself, not on the second
 *   channel over the locomotion; with a non-looped entry on top `FUN_00550ef0` does not run the ground state
 *   (418172-418246: `FUN_005870e0` only when the entry is cut), so the SEAL moves by the clip's root alone
 *   (`FUN_0028c250`): not at all on a throw (one root key), 0.4 over the claymore's 2.4 s.
 * - **A full lock, not a slow-down; the turn stays free.** The move axes are not scaled, they are not read; the turn
 *   (`actor+0x23c`) is zeroed only for a clip flagged `NoTurn` (`FUN_00587e00` at 418689-418692), and none of these is.
 * - **When it ends.** When a move axis or the turn passes 0.1 once the clip's phase is past its `NoInterrupt`
 *   (`FUN_00587c20` 445514-445576 with the stick test at 418180-418190), or at the clip's end. Every throw's release
 *   comes before its `NoInterrupt` (0.46 / 0.49 standing, the toss 0.69 / 0.75, crouched 0.70 / 0.8, prone 0.66 and
 *   0.56 / 0.9, the peeks' 0.55 and 0.87 / 0.9), so the grenade is always out first; the claymore is down at 1.3 s, its
 *   `NoInterrupt` 0.9 is 2.39 s.
 * - **What does not lock.** Holding the throw (the power's chase, `FUN_00594cf0` 0x595ea0-0x595f28: nothing there
 *   touches the move axes); the standing reload (`seal_reload` has no `NoInterrupt`: the first push cuts it, and
 *   `FUN_00550ef0` 418202-418214 carries it on as `Moving rifle reload`, the upper body's); a reload started moving
 *   (that overlay from the start); the Detonator (`CZKit_DetonateRemoteExplosives` plays no SEAL clip); a door (the
 *   action runs the door's zAnim, `FUN_002b44e0` from `FUN_00592d50` 452017-452018, which moves the leaf, not the SEAL).
 *
 * Each as `motion.rdr`'s `playback` and `NoInterrupt` and `MOTION_P.ZAR`'s key count and root travel, pinned against
 * both by `test/moverHold.test.ts`. `still`: only started at 20 a second or under (`FUN_005a82e0`'s `bVar3`).

/**
 * Simple shooting (web sprint 2, W2.5; the spec's §4 W2.5): a hitscan round along the aim, at the rifle's own rate,
 * a mark where it meets the hull, a magazine that counts down. No damage, no targets, no recoil beyond the reticle's
 * bloom, no sound (the spec's list).
 *
 * - **The rifle.** `@s2u/scene`'s `DEFAULT_RIFLE`: `RUN/ZWEAPON.ZAR/zweapon.rdr`'s M4A1, the first weapon of
 *   `READERC.ZAR/character.rdr`'s `mp_seal1` kit -- `FireWait 0.12` s between rounds (500 a minute),
 *   `Ammo_Capacity 30`, `NumMags 3`, `Maximum_Range 1000` (`scene/src/weapons.ts` cites the records).
 * - **The ray.** The game fires from the weapon model's `firepoint` node toward the aim point (`FUN_00297410`'s,
 *   1000 ahead along the pitched look: `playerCamera.ts`). WEAPON: with the rifle in the SEAL's hands the source
 *   gives that point (`FireSource.muzzle`: the posed `firepoint`, `./heldItem` -- `+0x14b0` plus the position, the
 *   path `GetPutativeFirePointW` 0x57fa70 takes with a1 false), and the round runs in two legs: the eye's ray along
 *   the view's centre line finds the point under the reticle (the aim point), then the segment from the muzzle to
 *   it finds what the round meets -- the same point unless something stands between the rifle and it (the
 *   convergence is research 79 §4's reading). Without a muzzle (no body, no clips) **the eye stands in for the
 *   firepoint**: the segment runs from the camera's eye through the aim point, `Maximum_Range` long, which lands
 *   under the reticle (the spec's §7, W2.1). `segmentHit` (`scene/src/segment.ts`) walks the grid the probe walks.
 * - **Which surfaces.** Every polygon, walls and floors. The engine's segment test skips bit-18 or bit-19 surfaces
 *   by `DAT_0044d758` (`segment.ts`); the five callers that set it to 1 (`FUN_0029bf70` the camera, `FUN_0057efe0`
 *   the headroom ray, `FUN_00596d60` the peek, `FUN_005aa6e0` a camera-side ray) are none of them a round, and the
 *   round's own path was not found in the sitting, so no class is applied (the brief's fallback).
 * - **The mark.** EFFECTS (`setMarks`, web/redotcom/docs/research/89 §5): the hit polygon's material's row of the rifle's
 *   `DecalSet`, projected along the round, none where the material has none. Without the tables,
 *   `READERC.ZAR/decals.rdr`'s `BULLET_MARK_SMALL` (the M4A1's `DecalSet`), its `STONE` row:
 *   `bullet_mark_stone.tif` (16x16, off every map archive's `RUN\COMMON\EFFE_TXR.ZED`: `hudBitmaps.ts`), a side
 *   between `MIN_SIZE` 1 and `MAX_SIZE` 1.8 units. The quad lies on the polygon's plane, `DECAL_OFFSET` off it toward
 *   the shooter, facing out. A plain dark disc stands in when the bitmap is absent. At most `MAX_DECALS` are kept,
 *   the oldest recycled (the game's `TEMP_DECAL_POOL` is 150 + 50 overflow: `decals.rdr`).
 * - **The magazines** (`./magazines`, research 84 §18): `NumMags` of `Ammo_Capacity` each -- the rifle 3 x 30, the
 *   Mark 23 3 x 12 -- kept as the game's ring (`m_reloads[slot][10]`), each magazine with its own rounds. A round
 *   leaves the one in the weapon; a reload puts in the next magazine round the ring with rounds (whole or part-spent,
 *   in order) and the one taken out keeps its rounds; the ammo box's MAGS is the magazines with rounds less one. `R`
 *   reloads over the reload clip's length when the source knows it (`FireSource.reloadSeconds`: `motion.rdr`'s
 *   `playback` of `seal_reload` 1.6, `seal_crouch_reload` 1.9, `seal_prone_reload` 1.7, `seal_mv_reload` 1.2 -- the
 *   M4A1's record has no `ReloadTime`, so the game's reload is its animation's), else over `RELOAD_SECONDS`
 *   [estimate]. The match's room counts with the same ring (`./net/room`).
 * - **The range** is `Maximum_Range` x `UNITS_PER_METRE` (10): the file's ranges are metres (research 84 §2).
 * - **The gun** (`setGun`, `./accuracy` through `main.ts`; research 84): the eye's ray leaves off the view's centre
 *   line by the reticle's cone and knock (`FUN_005bd100` / `FUN_00592260`), so the point it finds -- the one the
 *   muzzle's leg then fires at -- lies inside the reticle; the fire mode's rounds a pull (single 1, burst 3,
 *   automatic unlimited) and its wait (`FireWait`, x 0.8 in burst and automatic). Without one: straight down the
 *   aim, one round a `FireWait`, held for automatic.
 * - **The trigger.** A press fires at once if the wait has passed since the last round; held, it fires at the rate
 *   while the pull has rounds left. The tracer is drawn for one frame, from the muzzle (or, without one, a stand-in
 *   beside the eye: a line along the view's own centre line would be a point on the screen) to the hit.
 * - **The kick** (WEAPON, `./rifleKick`): the aim's pitch kicked by the stance's `FireRifleKick*` and let back, as the
 *   game's `FUN_005b91c0` / `FUN_005b9280` do, through the source's `look` and `kickPitch` -- **only scoped**: the
 *   game starts it only on a pull's first round in a scope and ticks it only in the 9x view or a scope (research 84
 *   §8), which the gun says (`kickStarts`, `kickTicks`). Unscoped the recoil is the reticle's knock alone.
 * - **The events** (`subscribe`, for the audio and the body): `round` each time a round leaves, with the weapon's
 *   name and id, the fire point in the world, the aim's end and whether it met the hull; `reloadStart` with the
 *   reload's length; `reloadEnd` when the fresh magazine is in (`completed`), or when a reset cut it short.

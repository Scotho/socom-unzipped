/**
 * The throw's clip on the body (the grenades workstream; web/redotcom/docs/research/85 §3): the clip `GetThrowAnim` picked,
 * played as the game plays a one-shot and laid over the locomotion as an `Animator` pose layer, the way the weapon's
 * reload is (`./weaponPose`) -- the clip picker and its cross-fade untouched.
 *
 * - **The clock** is the one-shot rule the motion workstream read (`./locomotion`, `FUN_0028c4f0`): the phase runs at
 *   `1 / (playback (n - 1) / n)` a second to its stop at `(n - 1) / n`, the key sampled `phase x n`; the release
 *   fraction is a phase (`@s2u/scene`'s `releaseSeconds`), so the hand lets go on the clip's own frame.
 * - **The blend**: in over the clip's `BlendTime` (0.2 on the crouched throw, else `FUN_00287620`'s 0.4), as a new play
 *   cross-fades; out over `BLEND_TIME_DEFAULT` once the clip holds its last key, as the locomotion's play that follows
 *   would cross-fade in [reading: the play after a throw is not traced].
 * - **The callbacks**: `motion.rdr`'s `zanim_callback`s on the clip (`throw_whoosh` at 0.45 on the standing throw: the
 *   grunt `.MALE_GRUNT`) as the phase crosses them, for the page's audio.

/**
 * The night vision's colour as the engine applies it (research 84 section 14; web/redotcom/docs/research/82, round 4).
 *
 * Going into the goggles (`FUN_005c1800`, zoom state 3) the game calls `FUN_003b78d0(0, LensFX_NVG)`: four rows at
 * `0x4b4c70`, each `(0.33 r, 0.33 g, 0.33 b, 3.0303 a)` of the map's lens -- `(0.2, 0.898, 0.2, 0.24)` on every map --
 * and the flag `0x4b4a68`. While the flag is up every world and character packet (`FUN_003b41d0`, `FUN_003b5f20`) puts
 * VU1 command `0x5c` (`0x5e`/`0x60` for the other colour buffers) after the lighting (`0x18`, or the flat `0x54`) and
 * before the output (`0x28`), with the draw's row in its header (qword 13, `FUN_003b6870`, stored to VU `328`). The
 * command (`0x4d8`) rewrites each lit vertex colour in place:
 *
 *   `ACC = row * c.x; ACC += row * c.y; ACC += row * c.z; c.xyz = ACC + row * row.w`
 *
 * i.e. `c' = row.rgb * (R + G + B + row.a)`, alpha kept, in the lane's 0..255 units (128 the GS's unity) -- a lens-green
 * monochrome of the lit colour at about its brightness, which the textures then modulate. The fog's colour becomes the
 * lens's times its own (`cam+0xd0`). Leaving, `FUN_003b78d0(0.25, (1, 1, 1, 0))` sets the neutral rows, which drop the
 * flag (`FUN_003b7170`, once a frame: every row `(0.33, 0.33, 0.33, 0)`).
 *
 * The viewer's lit colours are in units of the GS's unity (1 = 128), so the row's `a` term is divided by 128.

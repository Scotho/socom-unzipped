/**
 * The rifle's poses over the clips (the WEAPON workstream): the **Fire** set the game blends in while the rifle is up
 * (`./weaponRaise`), and the **reload**. An `Animator` pose layer (`addPoseLayer`), so the clip picker and its
 * cross-fade are untouched.
 *
 * **The Fire set.** `FUN_005e0690` 0x5e0690 (decomp lines 494790-494801) pairs twelve anim types with their Fire
 * versions through `FUN_005e1bf0` (the table at `animset+0x5c`, entry +4); `CZSealBody_Tick_0` 0x57a330 (lines
 * 438828-438860), for a motion slot whose flags carry 0x40, maps the playing type back to its base (`FUN_0058c820`)
 * and on to its Fire version (`FUN_0058c970` → `FUN_005e1a10`), and blends that motion into the slot with the raise
 * weight (`FUN_0028bdd0(weight, ...)`); a type with no Fire version (the strafes, the jumps) blends nothing. The types'
 * clips are `READERC.ZAR/animset.rdr`'s "Seal anim set" (and the GLOBAL set it includes for `seal_walk`/`seal_jog`,
 * the clips the viewer's picker plays for Walk and Jog): Stand → `seal_fp_stand`, Walk → `seal_fp_walk` ... below.
 * The `fp` is "fire pose", not first person: "Fire stand" names `seal_fp_stand` (animset.rdr). Its rifle is at the
 * shoulder: the barrel along the body's forward, the sight 15.2 over the feet (research 78's skeleton, MP2).
 *
 * **Not the recoil clips.** `animset.rdr` binds "Rifle recoil" → `seal_recoil` (and the crouch, prone and pistol
 * forms), but no such type name is in the game's image (`socom2_game.elf` holds "Fire stand" and "Rifle reload" and
 * no "recoil" but `RecoilPct`): nothing asks for them, so they are not played. The body's kick is `./rifleKick`'s.
 *
 * **The reload** plays the stance's reload clip -- "Rifle reload" `seal_reload`, "Rifle crouch reload"
 * `seal_crouch_reload`, "Rifle prone reload" `seal_prone_reload`, and "Moving rifle reload" `seal_mv_reload` (an
 * upper-body overlay, `BlendOverlay` in `motion.rdr`) -- over its `motion.rdr` `playback` seconds, which is also the
 * reload's length (`reloadSeconds`: the M4A1's record has no `ReloadTime`, research 79 §1.2 / the spec's W2.5).
 *
 * The viewer's readings, named:
 * - `PHASE_SHARED`: a Fire version of a locomotion cycle plays at the base clip's phase (so the legs keep their step);
 *   a Fire version of a pose (stand, crouch, prone, the steps) runs on its own clock at its own rate. The game makes a
 *   second motion for it (`FUN_0028d860(slot, motion, -1)`), whose clock is not read here.
 * - `RELOAD_BLEND_PLACEHOLDER`: the reload clips have no `BlendTime` in `motion.rdr`, so they blend in and out over
 *   0.2 s, the viewer's (research 84 s11: the game's cross-fade into a motion
 *   with no `BlendTime` is `FUN_00287620`'s 0.4, `./locomotion` `BLEND_TIME_DEFAULT`; the reload overlay's path is not traced).
 * - The moving reload is the game's `FUN_005a82e0` test (`RELOAD_STILL_SPEED`), frame by frame at the same normalised
 *   time: a still reload the SEAL walks out of turns into the moving overlay (`FUN_00550ef0` 418205-418224).
 */

/**
 * The Fire version of each clip the picker can play (`FUN_005e0690`'s twelve pairs through animset.rdr's names).
 * Keys are the base clips: the Seal set's own and the GLOBAL set's, which the viewer's picker plays.

/**
 * The SEAL's kit slots and the rifle <-> pistol swap (the WEAPON workstream's sidearm round). What the game does:
 *
 * - **The slots.** `mp_seal1`'s kit is M4A1, Mark 23, M67, HE, ... (`READERC.ZAR/character.rdr`; the viewer's rifle is
 *   W2.R4's M4A1 SD). The player control (`FUN_00594cf0`, decomp 453288-453312) reads L1 (pad button 9) as a press
 *   of the slot kept at `ctrl+0x224` and L2 (button 10) the one at `+0x228`; the controller's constructor
 *   (`FUN_00598280`, 454785-454786) sets them to 0.0 and 1.0 -- slot 0, the primary, and slot 1, **the sidearm**. R2 is
 *   the Inventory (`FUN_0021bda0`'s menu over every slot): the grenades are reached there, not on L2.
 * - **The gate** (`FUN_005a8cb0`, `FUN_005bdc30`, the slot's count, `FUN_005c4fd0`, else the denied sound
 *   `FUN_003419c0`), then `FUN_005c4b10`: the slot already in the hand does nothing (**no toggle back**); a scope drops
 *   (the game's to first person; the viewer's to the third-person view -- it has no first person, owner 2026-09-29);
 *   the kit's selected slot `+0x824` is set, and a change of category (`FUN_005c50b0`) starts the swap through
 *   `FUN_005c1660` -> `FUN_005a64c0`, whose clip choice the MOTION workstream ported (`WalkMode.swapWeapon`).
 *   Refused while reloading, while a swap runs, while throwing, in the air.
 * - **Rifle to pistol.** At the start `FUN_005a7260` re-parents the rifle to `spinelo` (the clip's own `rifle` track
 *   poses it there) and sets `m_item` to 2 at once; `FUN_0057d5e0` turns the playing clips to their pistol versions.
 *   A callback in the clip (`FUN_005a7730`) moves the pistol to `rhand` at the hand-off (`HAND_OFF`); at the end
 *   `FUN_005a60d0(seal, 2, 0)` hangs the rifle on `spinelo` at `character.rdr`'s "rifle" offset.
 * - **Pistol to rifle.** The same clip played backwards; its callback (`FUN_005a75d0`) holsters the pistol on `rthigh`
 *   at the "pistol" offset as the clip passes the hand-off going back; at the end `FUN_005a70f0` puts the rifle in the
 *   hand and sets `m_item` to 1.
 * - **At spawn** the pistol hangs on `+0x304` (`hips`) at the identity (`FUN_00553290` slot 2).
 *
 * The viewer's readings, named: the hand-off points are the clips' normalised phases the callback fires at
 * (`HAND_OFF`, research of this round: "not settled" -- where the clip's `pistol` track reaches the hand's hold); the
 * swap's progress is the pick's own seconds (the walk's action or overlay runs the clip on the same clock).

/**
 * The SEAL's clips on the mover, played the game's way (web sprint 2 W2.2b; the motion workstream's port, web/redotcom/docs/
 * research/80-the-jump.md): each frame the mover's state -- its action (the jumps, the landings, the stance
 * transitions) or its ground state and stick -- names a **play**, the game's `FUN_0028dc90` play on the skeleton at
 * `actor+0x170`: a list of nodes (a motion, a weight, a speed) sharing one phase (`./locomotion`).
 *
 * - **Locomotion** is the game's pick and blend, rebuilt every tick with no cross-fade inside it (`FUN_0028bef0` swaps
 *   the node list): standing, the forward/back set and the strafe set shared by the stick's angle (`FUN_00583030`),
 *   each set's clips chosen and split by their transition bands at the stick's speed (`FUN_0058bdf0`); crouched the
 *   one set of the direction class (`FUN_00582d10`); prone the crawl or the prone strafe (`FUN_00583500`). Every clip
 *   plays at the speed that makes its root travel the mover's speed, whatever that is -- no clamp.
 * - **A new play** (a new action, locomotion starting or stopping, a crouch or prone class change) cross-fades from the
 *   pose on screen over the new motion's `BlendTime` (0.4 when `motion.rdr` gives none, `FUN_00287620`), keeping the
 *   phase when both are loops (`FUN_0028dc90`); a stance transition played backwards starts at its end (`FUN_0028c160`).
 * - **One-shots** play keys 0 to n - 1 in `playback x ((n - 1) / n)^2` seconds and hold there (`FUN_0028c4f0`,
 *   `FUN_0028d670`; `./locomotion` `oneShotSeconds`).
 * - **Events** for the page (the audio): each `zanim_callback` as the phase crosses it (`FUN_0028c9e0`), and each
 *   footfall -- the left foot as a moving locomotion phase enters (0, 0.5), the right as it enters (0.5, 1)
 *   (`FUN_005a3570`, decomp 460266-460382) -- and each play started (`onEvent`).
 *
 * **The root.** The mover owns the position: the clip's root travel is not applied to it, and the body's root is stood
 * over the feet at the bind's x and z. The root's height is the clips', blended, so a crouch lowers the body and the
 * standing jump's clip lifts it -- and the camera reads it (`rootY`, `WalkMode.setPosedRoot`).

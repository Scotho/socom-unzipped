/**
 * The opening stand (web sprint 1, W1.4b): where the fly camera stands when a map with measured spawns loads.
 *
 * Spawn A's (x, z), `EYE` over the floor the ground probe finds there. A's recorded y (`spawns.ts`) is the actor's
 * feet only on Frostfire and Vigilance (`KNOWN.md` section 1); on the other 20 maps it is the third-person orbit
 * camera's, 25 over the floor on flat ground (the spec's W1.4 finding, W1.R10), so a stand at the recorded y +
 * `EYE` stood about 45 over the floor there. The probe is `probeFloor` from the recorded y: the origin y + 5 and
 * research 24 section 2's pick -- the highest candidate at or under the origin + 1, else the lowest, none more than
 * 20 over y -- which finds a floor under all 44 rows, feet and camera alike (`tools/probe-spawns.ts`: the 4 feet
 * rows 0-1.1 over theirs, the 40 camera rows 12.7-38.1). Where it finds none, or the map has no ground, the stand
 * is the recorded y + `EYE`, as it was before W1.4b.
 *
 * The (x, z) stays A's own: on the 20 camera-row maps that is where the player's camera opened, 20-28 units
 * behind the actor's slot (web/redotcom/docs/research/75 §11), and the view from it toward B is the one they saw.

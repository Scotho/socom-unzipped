/**
 * The rifle in the SEAL's hands (the WEAPON workstream; the owner's playtest: "no weapon model visible").
 *
 * **How the game hangs it.** The SEAL's skeleton has no weapon node on disc (`CLIB_GEO`'s 26 slots, research 78 §3);
 * the body makes them. `CZSealBody`'s constructor (decomp lines 419640-419690, the 25 `FUN_0028e7b0` part look-ups
 * into `+0x2e8..+0x348` in reCOM's order: `+0x2fc` spinelo, `+0x300` rhand) sets `m_item` (`+0xf79`) to 1, the rifle,
 * and calls `FUN_00553290` 0x553290 for slots 1 and 2: each makes a fresh `CNode` (`FUN_00316e30`), names it "rifle"
 * (slot 1, the string at 0x65c498) or "pistol" (slot 2), and adds it to the body (`FUN_0028ebe0`) under **`rhand`
 * when that item is the one in hand**, else under the carry part -- `spinelo` for the rifle, whose offset there is
 * `character.rdr`'s "rifle" gear (`NONAME.flt` on spinelo, `FUN_0058b0f0`'s `FindGear("rifle")`). The node's pose
 * is the clips': the pack's clips carry a `rifle` track (a constant `(1.266, 0.258, -0.148)` from the hand in most,
 * turned through the run), a few the SOCOM 1 name `weapon` (`./animator` `partIndex`).
 *
 * **The model on it.** `WEAP_GEO`'s M4A1 SD (research 79 §2.2) is modelled with its grip at the origin, the barrel
 * along +x, up +y; hung at the node's identity, `seal_fp_stand` puts the barrel along the body's forward (-z) to
 * within two degrees and the sight 15.2 over the feet at the cheek, `seal_stand` carries it at the low ready, the
 * left hand under the fore-end in both (measured on MP2's skeleton): the node is the grip.
 *
 * **The fire point.** When the rifle is drawn the body looks up the weapon model's "aimpoint" and "firepoint" nodes
 * (`FUN_005a60d0` 0x5a60d0: `vtbl+100` with 0x65f658 / 0x65f668 into `+0x14ac` / `+0x14bc`) and keeps their places
 * relative to the actor (`+0x14a0`, `+0x14b0`); `GetPutativeFirePointW` 0x57fa70's second path returns `+0x14b0` plus
 * the position (research 79 §3.1) and the aim test `FUN_0054ea80` fires from it. So a round leaves the posed
 * weapon's `firepoint`: `muzzleOf`.
 *
 * The viewer's reading, named: the node's rest (the bind) is the identity -- a fresh `CNode`; every clip the picker
 * plays moves it.

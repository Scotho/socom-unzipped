 * `AIMAPS.MPS`, the AI map file each `RUN/MP*.ZDB` carries beside its ZARs. It is not a ZAR
 * (web/redotcom/docs/research/72 §1, §6) and holds no members: a head, one record per AI sub-map (the grids
 * `aimaps.rdr`'s `map_list` names), and a trailer. Every field read here is laid out in
 * web/redotcom/docs/research/75, which checks each one on all 22 archives -- 83 sub-maps -- and the reader
 * holds the layout to the one proof a byte format has without its writer: it consumes every file to
 * its last byte, and throws when a count, a size or the file's length disagrees.
 *
 * This sits in `scene`, not `archive`: it is a record format, not a container -- nothing in it is
 * looked up by name -- and what it yields is placed in the world (cell centres, spawn slots), beside
 * `spawns.ts`, the measured table it is checked against. The bytes are read through archive's `Reader`.

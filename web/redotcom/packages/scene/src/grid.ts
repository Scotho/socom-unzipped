/**
 * The engine's grid, `zdb::CGrid`: the map cut into square cells on the ground plane, every object linked into
 * each cell its bounds cover, and a walk over the cells outward from the camera. The draw walks it
 * (`CPipe::RenderWorld`, `research/recom/src/gamez/zRender/zrndr_pipe.cpp:207`) and so does the ground probe
 * (research 23 section 1.1, 24 section 1.1). Nothing of it is on the disc but `grid_params` (`worldRoot.ts`):
 * the cells are generated at load (`CGrid::Create`, `zGrid/grid_main.cpp:35-147`; `web/redotcom/docs/research/72`
 * section 6).
 *
 * What the viewer links, and what it does not copy from the engine:
 *
 * - **Placements** (`placeInstances`): one object per drawn placement, filed by its node's bbox carried into the
 *   world by two corners (`worldFootprint`). The engine links nodes -- a world child (type 1) or a top-level
 *   instance (type 2), each with its whole subtree -- not each visual-bearing node (research 23 section 2.1).
 * - **Clutter** (`placeClutter`'s placements): one cell each, by position. The engine's clutter reader hands
 *   back the record's position and its caller takes `.x`/`.z` for the cell (`FUN_002d9490`, `sub_002D55C0`;
 *   `clutter.ts`), into the cell node's own clutter list (`CCell::m_clutterList`, `zGrid/zgrid.h:37`), drawn when
 *   the walk reaches the cell node (`zrndr_pipe.cpp:209-248`, `RenderClutter` at `:248`) -- so here it heads each
 *   cell's list.
 * - **Collision**: one object per *node that owns polygons*, its polygons in surface order, filed by their
 *   world-space extent. The engine reaches a polygon only through its model's atom and takes the first hit per
 *   model in surface order (research 23 section 1.1), so that is the unit; one atom per polygon would also spend
 *   more than the pool's 8,192 on 16 of the 22 maps, up to 24,514 on MP82 (counted 2026-09-28).
 *
 * The pool is not emulated: a grid never runs out, and `atomsSpent` says what it would have taken.

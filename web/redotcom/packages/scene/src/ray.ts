/**
 * A ray against the hull (W2.4; web/redotcom/docs/research/79 §4): the first collision polygon a segment meets, found
 * through the grid the probe walks (`grid.ts`, `probe.ts`) -- the cells the segment crosses in the order it crosses
 * them, each cell's collision atoms, each owner's polygons.
 *
 * **Not the engine's routine.** The shot's own intersection -- `CZProjectile_PostTick` 0x3c9fb0,
 * `CZSealBody_HandleWeaponIntersect` 0x549f30, the `DiIntersect` records they fill -- is named but not decompiled
 * here, and `CDIPoly::GetIntersect`'s VU0 edge tests are not decoded (the probe's file says the same of the vertical
 * line). What this takes from the engine is its data and its gate: the hull the probe reads, owned per node and
 * linked into the grid as `CGrid` links it, `modelGate`'s per-model test, and the probe's skip of a surface with
 * bit 18 set (`m_cameratype` bit 0, the doorway volumes: research 23 §1.1, 24 §2). Both faces of a polygon count.
 *
 * **The walk.** The segment's footprint on the ground plane steps from cell to cell (a 2D DDA over the grid's
 * `m_InvCellDim`); a cell off the grid is the edge cell it clamps to, as `CGrid` clamps an object that lies off it,
 * so a polygon filed there is still met. An owner filed in several cells is tested once, at the first, for all of
 * its polygons; the walk stops once the nearest hit so far is no further than the cell being left, since every
 * polygon of a later cell lies further along. That makes the answer the nearest hit whatever order a cell lists
 * its atoms in.

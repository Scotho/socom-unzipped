 * The yellow arc SOCOM II draws while a grenade is held (web/redotcom/docs/research/85 §11). `CSealCtrl`'s draw method
 * (`FUN_005970b0`, the player controller's vtable slot at 0x6694ec) works out the throw exactly as the release will
 * (`GetThrowAnim`'s table point, `ComputeMaxVel`, the aim plus `ComputeElevOfs`, the power's speed, the aimed
 * correction) and hands the hand's world point and the velocity to `ai::DrawFunc<CDynGrenade>` (`FUN_00598860`),
 * which draws the analytic parabola `p + v t + (0, -49 t^2, 0)` as a strip of line segments. It is not a trace: no
 * hull query, no bounce, no impact marker (the impact point `FUN_005970b0` works out at sp+0xb0 is never read).

 * - `start`: the first time, seconds, the `lui 0xbf80` at 0x597498 (`-1.0`): the arc begins a second *before* the
 *   hand, back down the parabola (under the ground behind the SEAL, where the depth test hides it);
 * - `endScale`: `DAT_00650608` = 2, times `ComputeTimeToImpact`'s time to fall to the feet's level;
 * - `alpha`: `DAT_006505f8` 0.75 at the start to `DAT_00650600` 0.1 at the end (`FUN_006000f0`, `FUN_006000a0`),
 *   clamped to 0..1 (0x650d70, 0x650d78);
 * - `color`: (0.78, 0.78, 0) (`0x3f47ae14`, 0x59743c) -- the yellow; `nightColor` (1, 1, 0.8) in view mode 3, the
 *   night vision (`FUN_005c80f0`).

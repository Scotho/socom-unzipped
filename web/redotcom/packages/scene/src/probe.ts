/**
 * The engine's ground probe, over the grid (`grid.ts`): what stands under a point, and which of it is the floor.
 *
 * The call chain is research 23 section 1.1's, read off the decomp and replayed against 1,152 recorded actor rows
 * by research 24 section 3 (median residual 0.004):
 *
 * 1. **The query** (`FUN_002d3cf0` -> `FUN_002d3030`). A type-1 record is a vertical line `(x, +-50000, z)`. It
 *    marks the one cell holding `(x, z)` and walks that cell's atoms, testing each model: the gate (`m_active`,
 *    `m_hasDI`, the layer against the record's mask), the model's bbox, then its surfaces in order -- a surface
 *    with bit 18 set is skipped, a type-1 probe wants bit 0 -- and **the loop stops at the model's first hit**.
 *    The recursion into children (`+0x70`) is the grid's collision owners here: `collisionOwners` gives every
 *    realised node that carries polygons its own owner, linked into the cells its polygons cover.
 * 2. **The selection** (`FUN_005b5d40`): the highest candidate at or under the origin's y + 1, else the lowest;
 *    rejected when it is more than 20 over the actor's feet. The origin is the actor's x, z and its y plus the
 *    root bone's lift, about 5 (research 23 section 1.2: +4.7 / +5.5 in the images; research 24 takes 5). Only x
 *    and z reach the query; y only feeds this window.
 *
 * **World space, not model space.** The engine carries the line into each model's space with the inverse of the
 * model's matrix (`FUN_00308160`, `FUN_003085c0`), tests it there, and carries the hit back (`vcallms 0x80`). The
 * viewer keeps its polygons in world space (`worldCollision`, the same composed matrices) and tests the world line
 * against them. An invertible affine map preserves which polygon a line crosses and where, so the two find the
 * same polygons at the same points; what differs is float rounding, far below the selection window. The line's
 * +-50000 is every height on every map either way.
 *
 * **The bbox reject** (`FUN_003124f0`, the model-space line against the node's bbox) is the owner's footprint
 * here: every `di` polygon of all 22 maps lies inside its own node's `nparams` bbox in x and z (measured
 * 2026-09-28), so the reject can only drop a line that misses every polygon of the node, and the footprint test
 * drops the same lines and no others.
 *
 * **What is not modelled**, because the viewer has none of it: the self skip (`+0x3c`) and the characters flag
 * (`*(top+0xa1) & 4`), which concern actors; the material table's VOLUMETRIC and LIQUID candidates
 * (`0x44f358[m]+0x3c`, from the SOILS reader, which is not in a map's archive -- no Frostfire ground polygon uses
 * one, research 24 section 1.2); and `CDIBBox` surfaces, which on disc do not exist (web/redotcom/docs/research/72 section 6).
